        <section class="slide" data-markdown>
##Getting Started: Web Browser 

**[Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/en-CA/chrome/browser/)** - Choose a modern web browser that supports current web standards and has good development tools. To set Chrome as your default browser, follow [these instructions](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95417?hl=en). Another good option is Firefox. Visit [browsehappy.com](http://browsehappy.com) for more info about modern browsers.

You can view the source of any web page by right-clicking (or two-finger tap) on *any* web page! Let's go to http://ladieslearningcode.com and view the source. That's HTML.

**Developer tools** take it a step further and allows us to *inspect* any web page making it easier to test and debug code. The tools can be accessed in 3 ways:

* right-click / two-finger tap on a web page and select **Inspect Element**
* select the menu icon ![](framework/img/workshop/menu-icon-chrome.png) in the top right hand corner and select **Tools > Developer Tools**
* keyboard shortcut: **Ctrl + Shift + I** (PC) / **Cmnd + Option + I** (Mac)

        </section>

        <section class="slide" data-markdown>
##Getting Started: Text editor

You can write code using your computer's default text editor, Notepad (Windows) or TextEdit (Apple), but choosing a text editor with colour highlighting and other helpful features will improve your work flow.

**[Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/)** is a great option and is the editor we'll be using today. 

If you are unable to install Sublime Text, there are many free and paid [options](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTML_editors).  

Try [Notepad++](http://notepad-plus-plus.org/) (Windows) or [Atom](https://atom.io/) (Mac).

##What exactly *is* a website?

A website is basically a collection of web pages, aka **HTML documents**, that closely match a file folder structure.

![folder structure](framework/img/workshop/folder-structure.jpg)

| mysite.com (index.html) | mysite.com/about.html | mysite.com/contact.html |
|------------|------------|--------------|
| ![project home page](framework/img/workshop/project1.jpg) | ![project home page](framework/img/workshop/project2.jpg) | ![project home page](framework/img/workshop/project3.jpg) |

        <section class="slide basic-web-page">
            <h2>A Basic Web Page</h2>

            <p>Web pages are generally built using 3 web languages:</p>

            <p><strong>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)</strong> is a <em>markup</em> language used to define the content.</p>
            
            <div class="example">
            <p>I'm just a paragraph.</p>
            </div>
            
            <p><strong>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)</strong> is a <em>style sheet</em> language used to create the presentation and look of a site.</p>

            <div class="example css">
            <p>I'm a paragraph with <span>style</span>.</p>
            </div>

            <p><strong>JavaScript</strong> is a <em>programming</em> language used to define the behavior and add functionality to a website.</p>

            <div class="example">
            <p onclick="alert('clicked!');">I'm a paragraph that can be clicked. Try it!</p>
            </div>
        </section>

        <section class="slide">
            <h2>Setting Up Your Work Flow</h2>

            <p>Inside of the folder you downloaded today (<strong>llc-html-css-multi-page-site-master</strong>), there are many folders and files that contain different content.</p>

    <pre><code>llc-html-css-multi-page-site-master
    |-- framework // Contains files needed for slide presentation. Do not edit!
    |-- project // Contains files for today's workshop.
        |-- css // Only CSS files here.
        |-- examples // Example HTML/CSS files for each exercise.
        |-- final // Finished example for you to refer to.
        |-- images // Images for your project. You can also add your images here.
        |-- index.html // The first page / homepage of your site.
    |-- index.html // This is the file you're viewing right now (slides)!</code></pre>
        </section>

        <section class="slide" data-markdown>
##Setting Up Your Work Flow

Let's open the project files in the browser and text editor.

1. Open Sublime Text and go to **File > Open**.
1. Navigate to the **Project** folder (inside the folder you downloaded with today's slides).  
With the entire folder selected, select **Open**.
1. The folder will appear in the side bar. Double click on **index.html** in the sidebar to open it.
1. Right click or two-finger tap in Sublime and select **Open in Browser**. This will open the HTML file in your *default* browser. 
    * If Chrome is not your default browser, go to your Window/Finder and navigate to the **project** folder, right-click/two-finger tap on **index.html** and choose **Open With > Chrome**
    
You should see this:

            #What is HTML?
            ##The content layer
        </section>

        <section class="slide" data-markdown>
##HTML tags

HTML was created for web browsers to read. To display content properly in the browser, use **tags**. Left & right angled brackets (`shift` + comma key and `shift` + period key ) surround the tag name. Tags *usually* come in pairs — an opening tag and a closing tag with a forward slash:

```xml
&lt;tagname>&lt;/tagname>
```
Just like the different languages that we speak and write, HTML has to follow proper "grammar" rules too. This is referred to as **syntax**. Also, note that tags are used to describe the content, **not** what they look like.  That's what CSS is for.

The are many different HTML tags used to create structure and add semantics (meaning) to the content.

```xml
&lt;p>I'm a paragraph because I'm wrapped by paragraph tags.&lt;/p>
```
        </section>

        <section class="slide">
            <h2>Nesting HTML tags</h2>

            <p>Tags are often nested within other tags and make up the <em>document tree</em>. The relationships are just like a family tree; branches of ancestors, parents, children, siblings, etc. Understanding this relationship will come in handy for writing CSS. Also, whitespace through indentation of nested elements makes HTML easier to read.</p>
            <pre><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;&lt;!-- child of html tag, parent of title tag --&gt;
        &lt;title&gt;&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;&lt;!-- child of html tag --&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</code></pre>   

            <ul>
                <li>
                    The <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> tag is always first and <strong>all</strong> other tags are nested within <code>&lt;html&gt;</code>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    What is the relationship of <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> to the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> tag? <span class="delayed"><em>child element</em></span>
                </li>
                <li class="delayed">
                    What is the relationship between the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> tags? <span class="delayed"><em>siblings</em></span>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="slide" data-markdown>
            ##Writing HTML

            To ensure that your tags are closed properly, write the open tag and close tag **first**, then move the cursor between the tags to add your content.

            ![opening & closing tags](framework/img/workshop/writing-html.gif)
        </section>
        <section class="slide" data-markdown>
            ##Writing HTML

            When nesting tags, make sure to indent by pressing the **tab** key once to clearly show which elements are nested.

            ![nesting tags](framework/img/workshop/writing-nested-tags.gif)
        </section>

        <section class="slide" data-markdown>
##Basic HTML document

We've seen these tags in our project file. These are the basic HTML tags required for every web page. 

    &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
    &lt;html&gt;
        &lt;head&gt;
            &lt;title&gt;&lt;/title&gt;
        &lt;/head&gt;
        &lt;body&gt;
        &lt;/body&gt;
    &lt;/html&gt;
    
* `doctype` - Though not an HTML tag, it is always the first line. It tells the browser what version of HTML the document is written in.
* `&lt;html>` - Always first, making it the ancestor of all other elements. It identifies the document as HTML.
* `&lt;head>` - Contains information about the web page but doesn’t display on the web page itself. Examples include the page title (`&lt;title>&lt;/title>`) and links to external CSS files.
* `&lt;body>` - All content to be displayed in the browser window, also known as the viewport, goes between the `body` tags.

            #Adding content
        </section>

        <section class="slide" data-markdown>
##Adding text

Heading tags are used for page headings. There are six headings tags ranging from `&lt;h1>` to `&lt;h6>` and follow a hierarchy. `&lt;h1>` is the most significant heading on the page.

```xml
&lt;h1>Name of blog&lt;/h1>
&lt;h2>Title of blog post&lt;/h2>
&lt;h3>Sub headings within blog post&lt;/h3>
```

Paragraphs are represented by the `&lt;p>` tag.

```xml
&lt;p&gt;This is a paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is another paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;
```

Links are represented by the `&lt;a>` (anchor) tag. The `href` *attribute* is needed to specify the link location (more on this later).

```xml
Visit &lt;a href="http://ladieslearningcode.com">Ladies Learning Code&lt;/a>.
```
        </section>

        <section class="slide">
            <h2>Exercise #1 - Updating your home page (5 mins)</h2>

            <ol>
                <li>In the Sublime Text editor, update your name in the <code>h1</code> tag if you haven’t already.</li>
                <li>Add your tag line under your name using the appropriate heading tag.</li>
                <li>Change the content in the <code>title</code> tag. Where do you see this change?</li>
                <li>Add a copyright message using a paragraph (<code>p</code>) tag <em>inside</em> of the <code>footer</code> tag.</li>
            </ol>

            <p><strong>Bonus:</strong> Try using an HTML code for the copyright <em>symbol</em>. Here are some resources: <br>
            <a href="http://character-code.com/ascii-table.php">http://character-code.com/ascii-table.php</a> <br>
            <a href="http://unicode-table.com/en/#00A9">http://unicode-table.com/en/#00A9</a></p>

            <p>Don’t forget to save and refresh your browser after each change!</p>

            <p>Your page should now look similar to <a href="project/examples/exercise1.html">exercise1.html</a></p>

            <div class="presenter-notes">
                <p>Use the exercise time to follow along with the current exercise. Since the exercises switch between code-alongs and independent exercises throughout the day, it will be easier to demonstrate the code-alongs if your version is at the same state as the learners.</p>
            </div>
        </section>

        <section class="slide project" data-markdown>
##Adding more HTML & content

All three pages have the same headings, navigation links and footer information.  Though the home page header and navigation *look* different from the other two pages, don't worry about that just yet. Right now we are just concentrating on adding the HTML. 

![project home page](framework/img/workshop/project1.jpg)
![project about page](framework/img/workshop/project2.jpg)
![project contact page](framework/img/workshop/project3.jpg)

**Protip!** It's best to write as much HTML & content as possible before adding CSS to ensure that the proper tags are being used. This will help keep your code organized and [semantic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_HTML).
        </section>

        <section class="slide" data-markdown>
##Navigation menu & Lists

Navigational elements are commonly created using lists. 

There are two kinds of lists in HTML: ordered (`ol`) for numbered lists & unordered (`ul`) for lists with bullets. Content must be included **only within the list item** (`li`).

Since the order of the list items doesn't matter for creating nav items, an unordered list can be used. 

```xml
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Unordered list item&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Unordered list item&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
```
```xml
&lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Ordered list item&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Ordered list item&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
```
        </section>

        <section class="slide" data-markdown>
##Links & Attributes

The purpose for creating page navigation is to link to other pages.  In addition to creating a list, we'll also need to add links to navigate between the three pages.

Links are represented by the `&lt;a>` (anchor) tag. Unlike the tags we've looked at so far, anchor tags need additional information to specify where to link *to*. An **attribute** can provide additional information and is *added inside the opening tag*. 

```xml
Visit &lt;a href="http://ladieslearningcode.com">Ladies Learning Code&lt;/a>.
```

In the above example, `href` is the *attribute*, `http://ladieslearningcode.com` is the *value*. 

Also, note that the clickable text goes in between the opening and closing a tags. 
        </section>

        <section class="slide" data-markdown>
##Links: Absolute vs Relative

This is an example of an **absolute hyperlink**. Much like typing a URL into the browser, it's "fully resolved" and starts with `http://`.

```xml
Visit &lt;a href="http://ladieslearningcode.com">Ladies Learning Code&lt;/a>.
``` 
Hyperlinks can also link to other pages within your own folder structure. The below is an example of a **relative path**. The path is relative to its place within the folder structure. If your HTML pages are within the same folder, they can be linked by using just the file name.

```xml
&lt;a href="about.html">About Me&lt;/a>
```

Remember, a website is basically a collection of pages linking to other HTML pages and files such as images and css files.
        </section>

        <section class="slide" data-markdown>
##HTML5 Sectioning Tags

Sometimes, multiple HTML elements need to be grouped together for organization and/or for styling. Prior to HTML5, the `&lt;div&gt;` tag was used for grouping elements. While it is still valid, HTML5 introduced a number of semantic tags that better describe blocks of content.  You've already seen two of them: `&lt;header&gt;` and `&lt;footer&gt;`. We'll be using a few more later on today.

For the navigation, adding a `&lt;nav&gt;` tag around the list will make it more semantic.  It can also be grouped with the headings by adding it *inside* of the `&lt;header&gt;` tag.

```xml
&lt;header&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;Jane Smith&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;h2&gt;Web Developer + City Girl&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;nav&gt;
        &lt;ul&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=""&gt;Home&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=""&gt;About&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=""&gt;Contact&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
    &lt;/nav&gt;
&lt;/header&gt;
```

        </section>

        <section class="slide">
            <h2>Class exercise: Add a navigation</h2>

            <p>Go back to <strong>index.html</strong> and create a navigation list for the three pages: <strong>Home</strong>, <strong>About</strong>, <strong>Contact</strong>.</p> 
            <p>Eventually we’ll have 3 HTML pages, <strong>index.html</strong>, <strong>about.html</strong> and <strong>contact.html</strong> so make sure to use <em>relative</em> links to these pages in the navigation list.</p>
<pre><code><header>
    <h1>Jane Smith</h1>
    <h2>Web Developer + City Girl</h2>

    <nav>
        <ul>

                <p>Anything titled “class exercise” is meant to be a type along exercise. For type along exercises, try to type out each code block rather than copy and paste from the slides to get learners to think about what they're typing about and get practice actually typing it. The code is there just as reference and for learners to have something to compare to outside of the workshop.</p>

##Creating HTML pages

To create an HTML page, name your file using an `.html` extension and it will open in your default browser (much like .pdf for PDF files or .doc for Word files). Here are some best practices and good file naming tips.

* Use lowercase letters.
    * **about.html** instead of **About.html** or **ABOUT.html**
* Avoid s p a c e s. Use underscores (`_`) or dashes (`-`). 
    * Note that [dashes are preferred for SEO](http://searchengineland.com/9-seo-quirks-you-should-be-aware-of-146465) (search engine optimization).
    * **business-hours.html** instead of **business hours.html**
    * The browser will interpret spaces as **business%20hours.html**
* Avoid symbols like `#` `&` `*` in your file name.
* Keep your file names concise, yet meaningful.
    * **about.html**, **contact.html** instead of **page1.html**, **page2.html**

**Protip!** These file naming tips can be applied to any files such as images, folders, CSS, etc.

            <h2>Exercise #2 - Adding pages and content (10mins)</h2>

            <p>We are just adding HTML content so don’t worry about how to style the page just yet. Writing code often requires a lot moving, deleting and adding content. Here are some more shortcuts that will come in handy to speed up your work flow.</p>
            <p>
                <code>ctrl/cmnd + c</code> to copy <br>
                <code>ctrl/cmnd + x</code> to copy and cut <br>
                <code>ctrl/cmnd + v</code> to paste <br>
                <code>ctrl/cmnd + s</code> to save <br>
                <code>ctrl/cmnd + r</code> to refresh browser
            </p>

            <ol>
                <li>Create an new page (cmnd/ctrl + n) and name it <strong>about.html</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Save it in the same folder as <strong>index.html</strong> (project folder)</li>
                        <li>Copy all the contents from <strong>index.html</strong> into your new page. It's is all the same content right now.</li>
                        <li>Update the <code>title</code> tag to reflect the contents of the page. (e.g. Your Name | About Me )</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Create a new page and name it <strong>contact.html</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Follow the same instructions as the About page.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Test the navigation. Are all the links going to the proper page?</li>
            </ol>
            <p>If you get stuck, you can take a peek in the <strong>examples</strong> folder: <a href="project/examples/exercise2-home.html">exercise2-home.html</a>, <a href="project/examples/exercise2-about.html">exercise2-about.html</a>, <a href="project/examples/exercise2-contact.html">exercise2-contact.html</a></p>

            <p><strong>Bonus:</strong><br> 
            Find an image to use as a profile picture for your <strong>About</strong> page.  The image should ideally be around 600 x 400px.  Here's a link to a free online tool for cropping images: <a href="http://apps.pixlr.com/editor/">http://pixlr.com</a></p>

##Leave a Comment

Sometimes you want to leave notes for yourself (or others) but don't want it to display in the browser. That's when comments can be really helpful. Comments can be used for:

* hiding code for later use
* leaving notes
* organizing the document

The syntax for comments start with `&lt;!--` and ends with `--&gt;`.

```
&lt;!-- This is my comment. Comments should always be included between the dashes. -->
```

##Image Types
There are many different file types that can be used for the web. Each type is best suited for specific kinds of images. Use the format that maintains the best quality while reducing the file size.

**jpg** - used for photographs with lots of rich colours or gradients

**png** - used for images with transparent or opaque backgrounds

**gif** - used for images with minimal colour variation and of course, for animated gifs!

**svg** - used for 2D graphics and is very scaleable. Based on XML and can be used as a image file or in the HTML document. When included as HTML, CSS can be used to style the svg!

**More about SVG:** http://css-tricks.com/using-svg

            <h2>Adding images</h2>

            <p>Images are an example of a void element/self-closing tag. It doesn't need a closing tag because it <em>is</em> the content. Read more about void elements <a href="framework/extras-void-elements.html">here</a>.</p>

            <p>Just like links, the image tag also requires an <em>attribute</em> to define the file path of the image file. However, it uses the <code>src</code> attribute (not <code>href</code>).  The value can be an absolute or relative path. The below is an example of an absolute path.</p>

            <pre><code>&lt;img src="http://fillmurray.com/200/300"&gt;</code></pre>

            <p><img src="http://fillmurray.com/200/300"></p>

            <p>If you don’t have a picture to use at the moment and need a placeholder, there are many services available such as:</p>

            <ul>
            <li><a href="http://placehold.it">http://placehold.it</a></li>

        <section class="slide" data-markdown>
##The alt attribute

`alt` is an optional image **attribute** and refers to *alternative text*. Alt text is read by screen reading software used by visually impaired users.

It also displays when there's a broken or missing image due to typos or moved files. It should be a short description of the image.

HTML tags can contain more than one attribute. Here's how you would use the `alt` attribute with the `src` attribute.

```
&lt;img src="images/profile.jpg" alt="Jane Smith">
```
        </section>
    
        <section class="slide" data-markdown>
##Adding your own images

Just like links, you can use a **relative** path to link to your own images.  It's common practice to create a folder to organize images separate from HTML files. 

In your **project** folder, there is already an **images** folder included in your download.  Use the default **profile.jpg** image contained inside or add your own to this folder.

Remember, relative paths are based on the folder structure.  Since the HTML pages are *outside* of the **images** folder, the folder name needs to be included in the file path.

```xml
&lt;img src="images/profile.jpg" alt="description of image">
```
        </section>

##Exercise #3 - Update the About page (15 mins)

Add a profile picture, heading and some information to your About page to make it look like this:

![example 3](framework/img/workshop/exercise3-about.png)

Use the `&lt;section>` tag to create a new sectioning block for the page content. Add it *between* the `&lt;header>` tag and the `&lt;footer>` like this:

```xml
&lt;header&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;Jane Smith&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;h2&gt;Web Developer + City Girl&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;nav&gt;
        ...
    &lt;/nav&gt;
&lt;/header&gt;

&lt;section&gt;
    page content here
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;footer&gt;
    ...
&lt;/footer&gt;
```

1. Inside of the `section` tag, add a profile picture using the `img` tag.
1. *After* your profile picture, add an `h2` for the About page title.
1. *After* the `h2`, add a couple of paragraphs about you, or use placeholder text.
1. We're going to need to work with some additional content in the afternoon so *after* the paragraphs, add a quote using another HTML5 tag. You can use this sample below, or add your own. Just make sure to keep the content within the `&lt;blockquote>` tag.

```xml
&lt;blockquote>
    &lt;p>The more that you read, the more things you will know. The more that you learn, the more places you'll go.&lt;/p>
    &lt;cite>― Dr. Seuss, I Can Read With My Eyes Shut!&lt;/cite>
&lt;/blockquote>
```
**Bonus:** Try adding a couple links. Ask a mentor how to get a link to open in a new tab/window.

Just like images, there are many services available for placeholder text.

#Intro to CSS
##The presentation layer
        </section>
    
        <section class="slide" data-markdown>
##CSS & HTML

Though CSS and HTML are closely paired, CSS is a different language and has its own syntax rules. 

CSS separates content (i.e. text) from presentation (i.e. text colour) and helps to reduce redundancy.  

Older presentational HTML tags like `&lt;center>` and `&lt;font>` should no longer be used because CSS takes care of presentation and styles.
        </section>

        <section class="slide" data-markdown>
            ##CSS Terminology & Syntax
    
            **Selectors:** Used to determine which element(s) to apply the styles to.  
            **Declarations:** Rules to follow & are written using `property:value` pairs.   
            Each rule must end with a semi-colon (`;`) to indicate the instruction.  
            All the rules for the selector must be contained within a pair of curly brackets `{}`.

            ```css
            selector {
                property: value;
            }
            ```
            **Properties** determine the type of style to be applied to the element.  **Values** are specific to the property. 

            ```css
            h1 {
                color: blue;
                font-size: 12px;
            }
            ```
            
            ![](framework/img/workshop/css-declaration.png)
        </section>

        <section class="slide">
            <h2>Write some CSS</h2>
            <p>Let's try changing the font-size of the paragraphs on this slide using the <code>font-size</code> property.</p>

            <textarea class="snippet">p {
    
}</textarea>
            <div class="example">
                <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit. Ipsam nesciunt sint beatae dolor dolorum aliquid quis explicabo vitae numquam, quas illo dolore molestiae ratione, perferendis, deleniti nemo ea voluptatibus! Quibusdam.</p>
            </div>
        </section>

        <section class="slide" data-markdown>
            ##Cascading

            CSS executes from top to bottom (hence "cascading"), so be careful of the the order of your CSS declarations. The declaration that comes *after* will override the one that came before.

            In this example, what colour will the `&lt;h1&gt;` be?

            ```
            h1 {
                color: black;
            }
            h1 {
                color: blue;
            }
            ```
        </section>
        <section class="slide" data-markdown>
            ##Inheritance and Specificity

            One of the strengths of CSS is styles can be inherited from parent to child elements using the family tree relationship between the elements.

            ```
            &lt;body&gt;
                &lt;h1&gt;My Website&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;!-- child of body --&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;This is a paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- sibling of h1 --&gt;
            &lt;/body&gt;
            ```
            ```
            body {
                color: blue;
                font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;
            }
            h1 {
                color: black;
            }
            ```

            In the above example, the CSS properties in the body selector is inherited by the children and descendants so all the text would be blue and display the Helvetica font. However, when a more specific selector is used (`h1`), it overrides the inherited values because it's more *specific*.
        </section>

        <section class="slide" data-markdown>
            ##Comments
            
            Comments in CSS are written within a slash & asterix (`/* */`) and closes in the opposite order. Comments can be used for the same reasons as HTML comments: leaving notes, hiding code for later and for organization.
            
            ```
            p {
                color: #cc0066; /* magenta */
            }

            /* HEADER STYLES */
            header {
                width: 80%;
            }

            /*  Saving this for later
            .slider {
                width: 100px;
                background: red;
            }
            */ 
            ``` 
        </section>

        <section class="slide" data-markdown>
##Referencing CSS

There are three ways to include (otherwise known as *referencing*) CSS in an HTML page. Today we'll be using the **external** method. To read more about **inline** and **internal**, view [this extra resource](framework/extras-referencing-css.html).

The external method links to a separate style sheet file and is recommended because it separates the CSS from the HTML document. Only the CSS file needs to be updated.

The style sheet is referenced in the `&lt;head&gt;` of the document with a `&lt;link&gt;` tag and two **attributes**, `rel` (relationship) and `href`. Just like links, the value of `href` points to the location of the style sheet. 

Though it is not required, css files are often saved in a separate css folder for organization, so make sure the file path points to the appropriate directory.

```
&lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;Page Title&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; href=&quot;css/style.css&quot;&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
```
        </section>
        
        <section class="slide" data-markdown>
##Class Exercise

In Sublime Text, create a new CSS file by selecting **File > New File** or use shortcut, **CMND/CNTRL + N**. Name the file with a **.css** extension.  Some commonly used names are global.css, main.css or style.css. Let's use **style.css** and add it to **about.html**.

**Protip!** Sublime Text has a shortcut.  Type "link" with no brackets, then the tab key. Voila!

```
&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="css/style.css">
```


Let's do a quick check to see if it works and is linked properly by adding a background color on the entire viewport as a test.

```
body {
    background: lightblue;
}
```
Notice that the content doesn't quite go to the edge of the page? That's because there's default spacing in the body element. 

![](framework/img/workshop/body-margin.png)

Remove the test background color and replace it with `padding` and `margin` to reset the value. (more on these later)

```
body {
    padding: 0;
    margin: 0;
}
```
        </section>

        <section class="slide" data-markdown>
            ##CSS colour values

            **keywords** - use the actual name for most basic colours (red, green, blue, pink, etc) as well as a few fancy ones like "papayaWhip" and "paleGoldenrod".    
            **RGB (red-green-blue)** - Uses *three* numerical values from 0-255. 0 represents black, 255 represents white. See below for syntax.    
            **hex code** - Made up of the number sign (`#`) followed by six hexadecimal characters (0-9, A-F).
            
            ```
            /* These are all the same colour */
            p {
                background: firebrick;
                background: #B22222;
                background: rgb(178,34,34);
            }
            ```

            ##Web safe fonts & Web Fonts

            Fonts can be changed with the `font-family` property. However, not all fonts are installed on all computers so it's recommended to use fonts that are considered *web safe* &mdash; fonts that are commonly included on most computers.

            It's best practice to list at least two or three font options to provide a fall-back option in case the user doesn't have the preferred fonts installed.

            ```
            body {
                font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;
            }
            ```

            Here's a handy resource for referencing web safe fonts: [CSS Font Stack](http://cssfontstack.com/).

            For more options beyond web safe fonts, services like [Google Fonts](http://www.google.com/fonts/) make it easier to add variety. Google Fonts allows you to link directly to their *hosted* style sheet and fonts and no file downloads are necessary. We'll be using this service in today's project.

            For more options beyond web safe fonts, services like [Google Fonts](http://www.google.com/fonts/) make it easier to add variety. Google Fonts allows you to link directly to their *hosted* stylesheet and fonts and no file downloads are necessary. To use these fonts:

            * Select the fonts you want to use and **Add to Collection**.  
            * You can **Review** them to take a closer look, then choose **Use** when ready.
            * Select font weights. The more you choose, the more it will slow down page load time.
            * The default character set should contain what you need. Only select an option if you need to add additional language support.
            * Grab the `&lt;link&gt;` code snippet and add it the `&lt;head&gt;` part of your page.
            * Use the new fonts with the `font-family` property as listed in the example on the Google Fonts page.

            That's it!

            <h2>Class Exercise - Typography</h2>
            <p>In this exercise, we'll focus on just updating the fonts. Your pages will look similar to this:</p>
            <img src="framework/img/workshop/exercise4-fonts.png">
            <p>Right now, we've only linked the css file to <strong>about.html</strong>. Continue to check the updates on that page.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Pick 3 fonts from <a href="https://www.google.com/fonts">Google Fonts</a>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Add the Google font style sheet before your CSS file.

<pre><code>&lt;title&gt;Jane Smith | About Me&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;link href='http://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Nixie+One|Open+Sans:300|Pacifico' rel='stylesheet' type='text/css'&gt;
&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="css/styles.css"&gt;
</code></pre>
                </li>
                <li>
                    In the sample project, most of site uses the same font throughout the page. So we can add the main font family to the <code>body</code> declaration block.
<pre><code>body {
    font-family: "Open Sans", sans-serif;
}
</code></pre>
                    Remember the family tree? Since <code>body</code> is the ancestor of all the elements nested within, these styles are inherited by the child &amp; descendant elements.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Make the main heading (your name) a different font to set it apart from the rest of the headings. Since this style is going to be applied only to the main heading, use <code>h1</code> as the selector.
<pre><code>h1 {
    font-family: "Nixie One", serif;
}
</code></pre>
                </li>
            </ol>

        <section class="slide" data-markdown>
##Combining selectors

Sometimes you'll have more than one HTML element that share the same styles.  Target multiple elements at the same time by *combining* selectors in one declaration block. Note the syntax, combined selectors need to be separated by a comma.

Instead of this: 
```
h1 {
    /* styles here */
}
h2 {
    /* styles here */
}
```
Do this!
```css
h1, h2 {
    /* selects both the h1 and h2 */
}
```
This does the same thing as the first example but with less lines of code and makes it easier to make changes to both elements.

        </section>
        <section class="slide" data-markdown>
##Exercise #4 - Typography (10 MINS)

Add some more font styles. Take a look at [example 4](project/examples/exercise4-home.html) for reference.

1. Link your Google Font style sheet & your **styles.css** file to **index.html** and **contact.html**. You will now be able to see the styles across all three pages.
1. In the sample project, most of site uses the same font color throughout the page. Add the `color` property to the `body`.
``` 
body {
    padding: 0;
    margin: 0;
    font-family: "Open Sans", sans-serif;
    color: #333; /* dark, almost black, gray colour */
}
```
1. Both `h1` and `h2` share similar styles. They both have uppercase letters and don’t use the default bold styles of headings. Combine the selectors to apply the styles in one declaration block. 
```
h1, h2 {
    font-weight: 300; /* removes default bold styles */
    text-transform: uppercase;
}
```
1. Links by default are blue in colour so it does not inherit the `color` property declared in the `body`. To change the colour of the link, use the specific element selector (a).

    Make the color different from the rest of the text to indicate it’s a link. You can also remove the default underline with CSS as well!
```
a {
    color: #bf6d50;
    text-decoration: none; /* removes default underline */
}
```

**Bonus:** If you have extra time, find an accent colour to use throughout your site and update the above color value with your accent colour. Here is the link to the [color resources slide](#slide42).

Or, find a background image for an upcoming afternoon exercise using one of the links below or choose one contained in your **images** folder. Here are some resources:

            #The Box Model
        </section>
            
        <section class="slide" data-markdown>
            ##What is The Box Model?

            The browser looks at every HTML element on the page as a box. 

            The CSS Box Model describes the way CSS styles the size and spacing of HTML elements. Understanding the box model is crucial for understanding how to position elements with CSS to create the desired page layout. This is one of the trickiest part of CSS, so don't worry if it seems confusing!

            CSS uses 5 properties to determine the size and spacing of these boxes:

            * `margin` - adds/removes space *outside* of the element
            * `padding` - adds/removes space *inside* of the element
            * `border` - adds a border outside of the element
            * `width` - can be set to a specific size via CSS
            * `height` - can be set to a specific size via CSS
        </section>

        <section class="slide">
            <h2>Padding and Margin</h2>

            <p>The <code>padding</code> and <code>margin</code> can both be declared using similar syntax of 1 to 4 values. Values can be declared using different measurement units but pixels or percentages are most commonly used. Setting the value to "0" will <strong>remove</strong> any default space on an HTML element. Any positive value will <strong>add</strong> space.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>4 values means top, right, bottom, left</li>
                <li>3 values means top, right/left, bottom</li>
                <li>2 values means top/bottom, right/left</li>
                <li>1 value means the same amount of padding on all sides</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Let's try changing some of the margin & padding settings below using 1-4 values and see what happens!</p>

            <textarea class="snippet" data-subject="#padding">background: lightblue;
width: 500px; 
padding: 0;
margin: 0;</textarea>
            <div id="padding">padding and margin test</div>
        </section>

        <section class="slide" data-markdown>
            ##Padding and Margin (continued)
            Both properties can also be declared by specifying a particular side.

            ```
            padding-top: 10px;
            padding-right: 10px;
            padding-bottom: 10px;
            padding-left: 10px;
            ```
            ```
            margin-top: 10px;
            margin-right: 10px;
            margin-bottom: 10px;
            margin-left: 10px;
            ```
        </section>

        <section class="slide" data-markdown>
            ##Border

            The `border` property resides between the `margin` and `padding` and creates an outline around the element. It, too, has longhand and shorthand syntax.
            
            ```
            /* longhand */
            border-width: 2px;
            border-style: solid;
            border-color: red;

            /* shorthand */
            border: 2px solid red;
            ```
            Like padding and margin, a specific side of the element can be specified.
            
            ```
            /* longhand */
            border-top-width: 2px;
            border-top-style: solid;
            border-top-color: red;

            /* shorthand */
            border-top: 2px solid red;
            ```
        </section>

        <section class="slide">
            <h2>Box Model Review</h2>

            <p>This diagram represents how all these different properties work together to change the size of an element.</p>

            <img src="framework/img/workshop/box-model.gif" alt="" title="">

            <p>The original element started with a width and height of <strong>400 x 100</strong>. After including the padding and border, the <em>size</em> of the box is <em>actually</em> <strong>452 x 152</strong>! That's because these properties add space inside the element by pushing the content outward.</p>

            <p>Margin takes up space but since it's <em>outside</em> of the element, it doesn't increase the size of the element itself.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="slide" data-markdown>
            ##Box Model Fix!

            Luckily, there’s a fix for this. Enter the [box-sizing: border-box](http://www.paulirish.com/2012/box-sizing-border-box-ftw/) fix ftw! This fix will allow you to add padding & border, without increasing the size of the box.  It pushes the content inward instead.

            It is recommended to add this snippet to all your projects. By adding this fix, you won't have to worry about `padding` and `border` increasing the size of your elements. 

            **Let's add it to our CSS file now**, to the very top of the file, since it's a global style.

            ```
            /* apply a natural box layout model to all elements, but allowing components to change */
            html {
                box-sizing: border-box;
            }
            *, *:before, *:after {
                box-sizing: inherit;
            }
            ```
        </section>
        <section class="slide" data-markdown>
##Class Exercise - headings and spacing

For next exercise, we are going to use `margin`, `padding`, `line-height` and `font-size` to update the heading styles and spacing of the content.

These changes will make the page go from the example on the left, to the one on the right.

![exercise 5](framework/img/workshop/exercise-heading-spacing.jpg)
        </section>
        <section class="slide" data-markdown>
##Class Exercise - headings and spacing

Now that **styles.css** is linked to all three pages, these next updates will apply to all of the pages. 

Add padding to the `header` and `section` so there's an equal amount of space around the content blocks.

```
header,
section {
    padding: 20px 30px;
}
```

Remove the default space from the `h1` and `h2` and set the line-height. Add it to the the existing `h1,h2` declaration block.

```
h1, h2 {
    font-weight: 300;
    text-transform: uppercase;
    margin: 0; /* removes default space */
    line-height: 1; /* tightens up the space between the headings */
}
```
Set the size of the headings **in the header**. We will use a **descendant selector** for this (more about this soon). We can also add a comment block for this section to organize the css.

```css
/* HEADER
-----------------------------------------*/
header h1 {
    font-size: 36px;
}
header h2 {
    font-size: 18px;
}
```
        </section>
        
        <section class="slide" data-markdown>
##Descendant selectors
    
Matches any element that is a descendant (nested tag) of the element declared before it.

```css
p a {
    /* targets only anchor link tags nested inside of a p tag */
}
```
**Protip!** Just like [Inception](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1375666/), don't go more than three levels deep.

```
nav ul li a span {
    /* NOOOOOOOOOOO */
}
```

Feel free to skip a level but be mindful of specificity rules. For example, `nav ul li a` would override `nav a` because it's more specific. It’s usually easier to start with generic selectors and make them more specific, as needed, rather than starting with very specific selectors and adding extra markup or classes to try to override the styles.

        <section class="slide">
            <h2>Block vs Inline Elements</h2>

            <p>Right now, our navigation list stacks on top of each other.  That’s because they are <strong>block</strong> elements.<br>
            By default, some HTML elements are displayed as block or inline elements.</p>

            <h3>Block Elements</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>takes up 100% width of its container, no matter how long the actual content is</li>
                <li>will be the same height as its content</li>
                <li>always starts on a new line</li>
                <li>can wrap other block level elements or inline elements</li>
                <li>can apply sizing related CSS to it (margin, padding, height, width)</li>
            </ul>

            <textarea class="snippet" data-subject="#block">background: lightblue;
padding: 0px;
margin: 0px;</textarea>
            <div id="block">I'm a div so that makes a me a block element.</div>
        </section>
        
        <section class="slide">
            <h2>Block vs Inline Elements</h2>
            <h3>Inline Elements</h3>

            <ul>
                <li>will be the height and width of its content</li>
                <li>always appears “in a line” with other inline level elements</li>
                <li>can wrap other inline elements but cannot wrap block level elements <em>except</em> <code>&amp;lt;a&amp;gt;</code> tags.  This is only valid with an HTML5 doctype.</li>
                <li>does not render CSS height and width at all, will apply margin and padding but with unexpected results</li>
            </ul>

            <textarea class="snippet" data-subject="#inline">background: orange;
padding: 0px;
margin: 0px;</textarea>
            <span id="inline">I'm a span. I'm an inline element.</span> 
        </section>

        <section class="slide" data-markdown>
            ##CSS Display property

            These default display styles can be changed using the CSS `display` property.

            `display: inline` can be used to get block level elements to line up side by side, in a line.

            `display: block` can be used to make inline elements behave like a block level element

            `display: inline-block` is the best of both worlds. Elements will line up side by side, like inline elements and also render sizing properties like block elements.
            
            `display: none;` will hide the element.
        </section>

        <section class="slide">
            <h2>Class Exercise #5 - Horizontal navigation</h2>

            <p>In this step, we're focusing on changing the default list styles to a horizontal layout. It will look like this sample below (also found in your examples folder, <a href="project/examples/exercise5-about.html">exercise5-about.html</a>).</p>
            <img src="framework/img/workshop/exercise5-nav.png" alt="">
            <p>First, remove the default list spacing and bullets.</p>
<pre><code>nav ul {
    list-style-type: none; /* removes bullets */
    margin: 0; /* removes default margin */
    padding: 0; /* removes default padding */
}
</code></pre>

            <p>Now we’ll want to target each <em>list item</em> to get the elements to line up side by side, in a line.</p>
<pre><code>nav ul li {
    display: inline-block; /* gets the list items to line up side by side */
}
</code></pre>

            <p>Add some space around the links. It’s better to put padding on the anchor link rather the the list item because padding adds space on the <em>inside</em>.  Putting it on the link with make the click area bigger.</p>

<pre><code>nav a {
    display: block; /* changes the element to block */
    padding: 5px 15px;
    text-transform: uppercase; 
}
</code></pre>
            <div class="presenter-notes">
                <p>Show learners the difference between putting padding in the list item vs anchor.  Just demonstrate it with your own code, don't get them to type along so they can just focus on the demo.</p>

        </section>

        <section class="slide" data-markdown>
            ##Being more specific - Using a Class

            HTML provides ways to attach extra identifying information to target elements in a more specific way. Classes are **attributes** than can be added to any tag and the value is define by you.
            ```
            &lt;p class="classname">&lt;/p>
            ```
            
            The class can then be used as a selector to apply styles to *any* element that references the class attribute and can be used multiple times on the same page. 

            In CSS, classes are denoted by a leading period.

            ```xml
            &lt;p&gt;Regular text&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;special&quot;&gt;Special text here.&lt;/p&gt;
            ```
            ```
            p {
                color: red;
                font-family: Georgia, "Times New Roman", serif;
            }
            .special {
                text-transform: uppercase;
            }
            ```

            Another attribute, `id`, can also be used as a more specific CSS selector and for linking within the same page. We won't be using `id` today but read more about its CSS usage [here](http://htmldog.com/guides/css/intermediate/classid/) and in-page linking [here](http://www.webweaver.nu/html-tips/link-within-a-page.shtml).
        </section>

        <section class="slide" data-markdown>
            ##class and id Names

            When choosing a class or id name, choose a descriptive name and do not use spaces. Hyphens (`-`), underscores (`_`) and camel case are acceptable. CSS is also case sensitive, so while these three examples look similar, CSS will read these as three different classes so it's important (for you own sanity) to pick one style and be consistent.
            
            ```
            class="content-wrapper"
            class="content_wrapper"
            class="contentWrapper"
            ```
        </section>

        <section class="slide" data-markdown>
            ##Class Exercise - Special text styles

            Let's create a `class` called `highlight` and assign it an accent colour. Try using the same colour as your links. Now, this class can be added to any element and it will apply this particular style.

            ```
            .highlight {
                color: #bf6d50;
            }
            ```

            Using a `&lt;span>` tag, wrap it around your first name on the homepage and apply this class. You can remove the space between the first & last name, to appear closer together. We use the span tag to wrap the content we want to apply this style to, without affecting the content around it. 

            ```xml
            &lt;h1&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;Jane&lt;/span&gt;Smith&lt;/h1&gt;
            ```

            Now it looks like this!

            ![](framework/img/workshop/highlighted-text.png)

            Add this anywhere you want some highlighted text!  Your name is also in the footer. That would be another good place to add this style.
        </section>
        
        <section class="slide" data-markdown>
            ##CSS Float Property

            Remember, block-style HTML elements like `&lt;p>`, `&lt;div>` and `&lt;section>` automatically start on a new line and stack on top of each other. That's why our content is currently just stacking on top of each other.

            ![](framework/img/workshop/about-not-floated.png)

            To get two block elements to align side-by-side, we've used `display: inline-block` for our navigation list, but the `float` property is often used for creating page layouts.

            **However**, we have to break the natural stacking flow when an element is floated. This will cause any element *after* the floated element to try to move up beside it or just not display properly because we've disrupted the natural stacking flow. The parent container will also collapse.
        </section>

        <section class="slide centered">
            <h2>Huh?</h2>
            <img src="framework/img/workshop/huh.gif">

            <p class="delayed">Not to worry, we can fix it.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="slide" data-markdown>
            ##Floating content

            For the next exercise, we'll use `float` to align the profile image and the text beside each other to make it look like this:

            ![](framework/img/workshop/about-floated.png)
        </section>
        <section class="slide">
            <h2>Float & Clear</h2>

            <p>First we have to break it, then put it back together. We need to “reset” the float to get the rest of the page to go back to normal.  There are a couple ways to do it.</p>

            <p>One of the most confusing CSS concepts is when to use the different techniques.</p>
            
            <p>Let’s look at an example: <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/e1nd3q89/">http://jsfiddle.net/e1nd3q89/</a></p>

            <p><strong>Rule of thumb:</strong><br>
             If there is an element that <em>follows</em> the floated elements, apply <code>clear: both</code> to that element. If all the elements need to be floated, apply the <code>overflow:hidden</code> to the <em>parent element</em> to force clear the children.</p>

##Class Exercise #6 - Update About page with Floats

Add a `profile-img` class to the image tag in your **About** page.

```xml
&lt;img class="profile-img" src="images/profile.jpg" alt="description of image">
```
In **styles.css**, add a new comment block at the bottom of the page for your **About** styles, to help organize your style sheet.  Then add `float` to get the text to wrap around the image. Also, add some margin to the right side of the image so there is some space between the image and the text.

```css  
/* ABOUT PAGE
-----------------------------------------*/
.profile-img {
    float: left;
    margin-right: 20px;
}
```

That looks much better but look what happened to the quote and the footer?! Remember, all elements that come *after* floated elements will want to float too, as long as there is space for them.  

Let's put the page back to its natural stacking order by *clearing the float*.  Put the `clear:both` on the `blockquote` element because that's where we want things to go back to normal. While we're here, let's also style the text in the quote and add some spacing.

```
blockquote {
    clear: both; /* clears the float and returns page back to normal stacking order */
    text-align: center; /* center aligns the text */
    padding-top: 20px; /* adds space between the blockquote & content before it */
}
blockquote p {
  font-family: "Pacifico", cursive;
  font-size: 25px;
}
```

Your page should now look similar to [exercise6-about.html](project/examples/exercise6-about.html).

            ##Positioning in CSS
            
            Sometimes floats and display just doesn't cut it for laying out page elements. 

            The `position` property can be used to place elements in specific spots on the page without affecting the elements around it the way floats do.  There are three options: `relative`, `absolute` and `fixed`. Elements are all `static` by default.

            `position` is used in conjunction with **offset properties**: `top`, `right`, `bottom`, and `left`. These are use to identify where an element will be positioned.

            To view more about positioning, check out this extra resource: [position relative, absolute & fixed](framework/extras-positioning.html).
        </section>

        <section class="slide">
            <h2>Class Exercise #7 - Positioning the Header &amp; Nav</h2>

            <p>Set the <em>entire</em> header to a fixed position so it stays in place at the top of the page on scroll.</p>

<pre><code>header {
    position: fixed;
    top: 0;
}
</code></pre>

            <p>Let's check these changes on our <strong>About</strong> page.</p>
            <p>Positioning also takes the element out of the natural stacking order.  See how the profile picture “jumped” underneath the header when <code>position: fixed</code> was applied? It’s because it doesn’t “see” that there’s an element before it, so it wants to slide up to the next available slot.</p>
            <p>Add some padding on the top of the <code>section</code> element to push the content down below the fixed header. Then try scrolling down the page.</p>

<pre><code>section {
    padding-top: 125px;
}
</code></pre>

            <p>Update the <code>header</code> css by setting the background to white so the content underneath doesn’t show through when you scroll the page. Also, add a border on the bottom to create a separation of the header from the page content.</p>

<pre><code>header {
    position: fixed;
    background: white;
    border-bottom: 1px solid #eee;
}
</code></pre>

            <p>Why doesn’t the header go all the way across? When you position an element, it automatically becomes the width of its content. Set the width to 100% so it becomes as wide as the browser. </p>

<pre><code>header {
    position: fixed;
    background: white;
    border-bottom: 1px solid #eee;
    width: 100%;
}
</code></pre>

            <p>Next up, position the <code>nav</code> to the top right of the header element. Since the header already has positioning applied to it, the nav will be relative to it.</p>

<pre><code>nav {
    position: absolute;
    right: 20px;
    top: 20px;
}
</code></pre>

            <p>Your page should look like <a href="project/examples/exercise7-about.html">example 7</a>.  Note how the header looks the same on all three pages now.</p>
            <p>Wait! The footer content disappeared on the home and contact pages!?</p>
            
            <div class="presenter-notes">

            ##Home page styles
            
            The home page and contact page currently doesn't have any content in it so the footer is just "underneath" the header. Once content has been added, it will push the footer down the page.

            However, the final design for the home page is different from the other two pages so we'll need to create special styles for the home page. 

            Let's use the `class` attribute to create a selector to allow us to apply specific styles just to the home page.

            Add the `class` to the `body` tag to override any styles, for any element, contained within the entire page.

            ```
            &lt;body class=&quot;home&quot;&gt;
            ```
        </section>
        <section class="slide" data-markdown>
            ##Class Exercise #8 - Homepage Header & Nav

            These are the styles we are going to change to update the home page.

            * remove the fixed positioning
            * remove the white background colour
            * remove the border bottom
            * center align the text
            * push the heading down from the top of the page

            We'll use the new `home` class we created to override the styles by using a more *specific* selector.

            ```
            .home header {
                position: static;
                background: transparent;
                border-bottom: none;
                text-align: center;
                padding-top: 100px;
            }
            ```
            Now let's update the heading sizes.  Feel free to use what looks good to you. These are just guidelines.
                
            ```
            .home header h1 {
              font-size: 120px;
            }
            .home header h2 {
              font-size: 40px;
            }
            ```
            
            If you haven't already, add the `.highlight` class to your first name, to match the styles on the other pages.
            
            ```xml
            &lt;h1&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;Jane&lt;/span&gt;Smith&lt;/h1&gt;
            ```

            Your page should now look something like [exercise8-home.html](project/examples/exercise8-home.html), located in your examples folder.
        </section>

        <section class="slide" data-markdown>
            ##Class Exercise #9: Background Images

            So far, we've used `background` to add colours but it can also be used it to add images for presentation, not content.
            
            ```
            background-image: url(path/to/file.jpg); /* longhand */
            background: url(path/to/file.jpg);/* shorthand */
            ```

            Since our CSS file is *inside* of a **css** folder, use `../` to go *up and out* of the folder to link to the image files. Let's add it to **index.html**. Create a `.home` declaration block so this image only displays on the homepage and spans the entire page. (There are a few to choose from in your images folder.)

            ```
            .home {
                background: url(../images/background-6.jpg);
            }
            ```
            
            Notice how the images repeat (unless you have a really large image). We can change that with another property, `background-repeat` or just add it to the shorthand `background` property.
            
            ```
            /* shorthand */
            .home {
                background: url(../images/background-6.jpg) no-repeat; 
            }

            /* longhand */
            .home {
                background-image: url(../images/background-6.jpg); 
                background-repeat: no-repeat;
            }
            ```
        </section>
        <section class="slide" data-markdown>
            ##Class Exercise #9: Background Images (continued)
            
            The image is no longer repeating but it doesn't fit the space either. Your page should look similar to the below (unless your image is larger than your resolution). We'll need to add one more property to fix this.

        <section class="slide">
            <h2>Class Exercise #9: Background Images (continued)</h2>

            <p>Thanks to CSS3, we can now change the size of a background image. </p>
            <p><code>background-size</code> is the longhand property.  To include it in the shorthand <code>background</code> property, it <em>must</em> be included after <code>background-position</code>, separated with the <code>/</code> character.  </p>
<pre><code>.home {
    background-image: url(../images/background-6.jpg);
    background-repeat: no-repeat;
    background-position: 50%;
    background-size: cover;
}</code></pre>

<pre><code>.home {
    background: url(../images/background-6.jpg) no-repeat 50% / cover;
}</code></pre>
            <p>If no background position value is being used, background-size won’t work in the shorthand property so in this case, it may be less error prone to add it via the longhand property.</p>
<pre><code>.home {
    background: url(../images/background-6.jpg) no-repeat 50%;
    background-size: cover;
}
</code></pre>
            
            <p>For good measure, since this image is a background image of the <code>body</code>, let's add one more rule to ensure the image covers the whole viewport and not just the height of the page content.</p>
<pre><code>html, body {
    height: 100%;
}

            ##Final Exercise: Forms!
            
            Forms are used to capture information from a user. The information processing and form submission usually requires the use of a server-side language such as PHP, Ruby or Python. But there are different services available to help do the processing for us without writing any of these languages!

            Let's look at the markup first.

            All forms begin with the `form` element and requires 
            two attributes, `method` (defines how the form will communicate with the web server) and `action` (provides the file path to where the form script is processed after the form is submitted.

            ```xml
            &lt;form method="POST" action="path/to/form/script/processing">
                ...
            &lt;/form>
            ```
        </section>

        <section class="slide">
            <h2>Class Exercise #10 - Contact Form</h2>

            <p>In <strong>contact.html</strong> under the header, a new <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> tag is required for the form content.</p>
            <p>Add the below markup after the <code>&lt;header&gt;</code>.</p>

<pre><code class="xml">&lt;section&gt;
    &lt;form class="contact-form" method="POST" action="" &gt;
        &lt;h2&gt;Let's meet for coffee!&lt;/h2&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Send me a message at &lt;a href="mailto:hello@your-email.com"&gt;hello@your-email.com&lt;/a&gt;, 
        use the form below or say "hi!" on one of my social networks.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            &lt;label for="name"&gt;Name&lt;/label&gt;
            &lt;input id="name" type="text" name="name"&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            &lt;label for="email"&gt;Email&lt;/label&gt;
            &lt;input id="email" type="email" name="replyto"&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            &lt;label for="message"&gt;Message&lt;/label&gt;
            &lt;textarea id="message" name="message"&gt;&lt;/textarea&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;input type="submit" value="SEND"&gt;
    &lt;/form&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
</code></pre>
            <p>Your contact page and form should look similar to <a href="project/examples/exercise10-contact.html">exercise10-contact.html</a>.</p>

            <div class="presenter-notes">

            ##Getting your site online

            To get your site online and available to the public, the folder containing the HTML documents and related files (images, css, javascript files, etc) must be moved to a *server* that *hosts* websites.

            To move web files from your computer to a server, an FTP program like [Filezilla](https://filezilla-project.org) or [CyberDuck](https://cyberduck.io) must be used.

            ##Getting your site online

            You will need to register a domain name (www.mysite.com) and get hosting. Here are a couple domain & hosting options:
            
            * [hover.com](http://hover.com/ladiescode)
            * [dreamhost.com](http://www.dreamhost.com/r.cgi?205190)  
            * [bluehost.com](http://www.bluehost.com/)

            To get your files online, you will need upload your files to your newly purchased hosting server.

            There are a few pieces of information you will need and are usually provided to you by your hosting service provider.

            * FTP Address
            * Username
            * Password

            Here's a nice tutorial getting your files online: [FTP For Beginners: How to Upload Your Files](http://webdesign.com/ftp-for-beginners-how-to-upload-your-files/)
