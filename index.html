##Getting Started: Web Browser 

**[Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/en-CA/chrome/browser/)** - Choose a modern web browser that supports current web standards and has good development tools. To set Chrome as your default browser, follow [these instructions](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95417?hl=en). Another good option is Firefox. Visit [browsehappy.com](http://browsehappy.com) for more info about modern browsers.

You can view the source of any web page by right-clicking (or two-finger tap) on any web page! Try visiting http://ladieslearningcode.com and view the source. That's HTML.

**Developer tools** take it a step further and allows us to *inspect* any web page making it easier to test and debug code. The tools can be accessed in 3 ways:

* right-click / two-finger tap on a web page and select **Inspect Element**
* select the menu icon in the top right hand corner of the Chrome browser and select **Tools > Developer Tools**
* keyboard shortcut: **Ctrl + Shift + I** (PC) / **Cmnd + Option + I** (Mac)

Extra resource: http://discover-devtools.codeschool.com
        </section>

        <section class="slide" data-markdown>
##Getting Started: Text editor

You can write code using your computer's default text editor, Notepad (Windows) or TextEdit (Apple), but choosing a text editor with colour highlighting and other helpful features will improve your work flow.

**[Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/)** is a great option and is the editor we'll be using today. 

If you are unable to install Sublime Text, there are many free and paid [options](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTML_editors).  

Try [Notepad++](http://notepad-plus-plus.org/) (Windows) or [Atom](https://atom.io/) (Mac).

##What exactly *is* a website?

A website is basically a collection of web pages, aka **HTML documents**, that closely match a file folder structure.

![folder structure](framework/img/workshop/folder-structure.jpg)

| mysite.com (index.html) | mysite.com/about.html | mysite.com/contact.html |
|------------|------------|--------------|
| ![project home page](framework/img/workshop/project1.jpg) | ![project home page](framework/img/workshop/project2.jpg) | ![project home page](framework/img/workshop/project3.jpg) |
        </section>

        <section class="slide" data-markdown>
##What exactly *is* a website?

To get your site online and available to the public, the folder containing the HTML documents and related files (images, css, javascript files, etc) must be moved to a *server* that *hosts* websites.

To move web files from your computer to a server, an FTP program must be used (more on this later).

            <h2>A Basic Web Page</h2>

            <p>Web pages are generally built using 3 web languages:</p>

            <p><strong>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)</strong> is a <em>markup</em> language and is used to define the content.</p>
            
            <div class="example">
            <p>I'm just a paragraph.</p>
            </div>
            
            <p><strong>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)</strong> is a <em>stylesheet</em> language and is used to create the presentation and look of a site.</p>

            <div class="example css">
            <p>I'm a paragraph with <span>style</span>.</p>
            </div>

            <p><strong>JavaScript</strong> is a <em>programming</em> language and is used to define the behavior and to add functionality to a website.</p>

            <div class="example">
            <p onclick="alert('clicked!');">I'm a paragraph that can be clicked. Try it!</p>
            </div>
        </section>

        <section class="slide title" data-markdown>
            #Dive into HTML
            ##The content layer
        </section>

        <section class="slide">
            <h2>Writing HTML</h2>

            <p>HTML was created for web browsers to read. To display content properly in the browser, use <strong>tags</strong>. Below are the basic HTML tags required for all web pages. This makes perfect sense to a web browser:</p>

            <pre><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</code></pre>

            <p>However, for us humans, whitespace through indentation will make your HTML easier to read.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;
        &lt;title&gt;&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</code></pre>
        </section>
        
        <section class="slide" data-markdown>
##HTML tags

The structure of a web page is defined by HTML tags. Left & right angled brackets (`shift` + comma key and `shift` + period key ) surround the tag name. Tags *usually* come in pairs â€” an opening tag and a closing tag with a forward slash:

```xml
&lt;tagname>&lt;/tagname>
```
The are many different HTML tags used to create structure and add semantics (meaning) to the content. For example, any content between the `&lt;html>&lt;/html>` tag tells the browser that it is HTML code and content between the `&lt;title>&lt;/title>` tag describes the web page title.

```xml
&lt;p>I'm a paragraph because I'm wrapped by paragraph tags.&lt;/p>
```
Just like the different languages that we speak and write, HTML has to follow proper "grammar" rules to make sense to the browser. This is referred to as **syntax**.

Tags describe the content that is inside of them, **not** what they look like.  That's what CSS is for.
        </section>

        <section class="slide">
            <h2>Nesting HTML tags</h2>

            <p>Tags are often nested within other tags. Nested elements make up the <em>document tree</em> &amp; the relationships are just like a family tree; branches of ancestors, parents, children, siblings, etc.</p>
            
            <pre><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;&lt;!-- child of html tag, parent of title tag --&gt;
        &lt;title&gt;&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;&lt;!-- child of html tag --&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</code></pre>   

            <ul>
                <li>
                    The <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> tag is always first and <strong>all</strong> other tags are nested within <code>&lt;html&gt;</code>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> is the child of <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> and the parent of the <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> tag.
                </li>
                <li>
                    What is the relationship of <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> to the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> tag? <span class="delayed"><em>child element</em></span>
                </li>
                <li class="delayed">
                    What is the relationship between the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> tags? <span class="delayed"><em>siblings</em></span>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="slide">
            <h2>Basic HTML Document</h2>

            <p>These tags are needed for every webpage. Let's talk about what each tag means.</p>

    <pre><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;
        &lt;title&gt;&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</code></pre>

            <p><code>doctype</code> - Always the first line though not an HTML tag. It tells the browser what <em>version</em> of HTML the document is written in.</p>

            <p><code>&lt;html&gt;</code> - It is always first, making it the ancestor of all other elements. It identifies the document as HTML.</p>

            <p><code>&lt;head</code>&gt;  - Contains information about the web page but doesnâ€™t display on the web page itself.  Examples include the page title (<code>&lt;title&gt;&lt;/title&gt;</code>) and links to external CSS files.</p>

            <p><code>&lt;body&gt;</code> - All content to be displayed in the browser window, also known as the viewport, goes between the body tags.</p>

##Setting Up Our Work Flow

To open the project files in the browser and text editor, follow these instructions:

1. Open Sublime Text and go to **File > Open**.
1. Navigate to the **Project** folder (inside the folder you downloaded with today's slides).  
With the entire folder selected, select **Open**.
1. The folder will appear in the side bar. Double click on **index.html** in the sidebar to open it.  
Basic HTML tags have already been included in this file.
1. Right click or two finger tap and select **Open in Browser**. This will open the HTML file in your *default* browser. 

What do you see? Your page should look like [exercise 1](project/examples/exercise1.html).
        </section>

        <section class="slide" data-markdown>
##HTML content: adding text

Heading tags are used for headings / page titles. There are six headings tags ranging from `&lt;h1>` to `&lt;h6>` and follow a hierarchy. `&lt;h1>` is the most significant heading on the page.

```xml
&lt;h1>Name of blog&lt;/h1>
&lt;h2>Title of blog post&lt;/h2>
&lt;h3>Sub headings within blog post&lt;/h3>
```

Paragraphs are represented by the `&lt;p>` tag.

```xml
&lt;p&gt;This is a paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is another paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;
```

Links are represented by the `&lt;a>` (anchor) tag. The `href` *attribute* is needed to specify the link location (more on this later).

```xml
Visit &lt;a href="http://ladieslearningcode.com">Ladies Learning Code&lt;/a>.
```
        </section>

        <section class="slide" data-markdown>
##Exercise #1 - Making & Saving Changes (10 mins)

1. In your text editor (Sublime Text), update your name and tagline
    * change the text *in between* the `&lt;h1>&lt;/h1>` and `&lt;h2>&lt;/h2>` tags
1. Save your file using keyboard shortcuts, **COMMAND** + **S** or **CONTROL** + **S**, or **File > Save**.
1. Go back to your browser and refresh it to see the changes.  
    * Use the rounded arrow in the right of the browser's address bar or use keyboard shortcut, **COMMAND/CONTROL** + **R**.
1. Change the content in the `&lt;title>&lt;/title>` tag. Where do you see this change?
1. Update the footer content in the `&lt;p>&lt;/p>` to include a copyright message.
    * Try using an HTML code for the copyright symbol. Here are some resources:  
    http://character-code.com/ascii-table.php, http://unicode-table.com/en/#00A9

Your page should now look similar to [exercise1-updated.html](project/examples/exercise1-updated.html)

**Protip!** Every time you make a change to your web page, don't forget to save and refresh your browser!
        </section>

        <section class="slide project" data-markdown>
##Adding content

Let's take another look at the final version of the site to determine what content and HTML tags to add. 

![project home page](framework/img/workshop/project1.jpg)
![project about page](framework/img/workshop/project2.jpg)
![project contact page](framework/img/workshop/project3.jpg)

All three pages have the same headings, navigation links and footer information.  Though the homepage's header and navigation is styled differently than the other two pages, don't worry about that just yet. Right now we are just concentrating on adding the HTML. 

It's best to write as much HTML as possible before adding CSS to ensure that the proper tags are being used and to help keep your code organized and semantic.
        </section>

        <section class="slide" data-markdown>
##Navigation menu & Lists

There are two kinds of lists in HTML: ordered (`ol`) for numbered lists & undordered (`ul`) for lists with bullets. *Content must be included only within the list item* (`li`).

```xml
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Unordered list item&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Unordered list item&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
```
```xml
&lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Ordered list item&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Ordered list item&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
```

Navigational elements are commonly created using lists. Since the order of the list items doesn't matter for creating nav items, an unordered list can be used.    
        </section>
        
        <section class="slide" data-markdown>
##Links & Attributes

The purpose for creating page navigation is to link to other pages.  In addition to creating a list, we'll also need to add links to navigate between the three pages.

Links are represented by the `&lt;a>` (anchor) tag. Unlike the tags we've looked at so far, anchor tags need additional information to specify a link location. An **attribute** can provide additional information and is added inside the opening tag. 

```xml
Visit &lt;a href="http://ladieslearningcode.com">Ladies Learning Code&lt;/a>.
```

In the above example, `href` is the *attribute*, `http://ladieslearningcode.com` is the *value* of that attribute. 
Also, note that the clickable text goes in between the opening and closing a tags. 
        </section>

        <section class="slide" data-markdown>
##Links: Absolute vs Relative

This is an example of an **absolute hyperlink**. It's "fully resolved" and starts with `http://` much like typing a url into the browser.

```xml
Visit &lt;a href="http://ladieslearningcode.com">Ladies Learning Code&lt;/a>.
``` 
Hyperlinks can also link to other pages within your own folder structure. The below is an example of a **relative path**. The path is relative to its place within the folder structure. If your HTML pages are within the same folder, they can be linked by using just the file name.

```xml
&lt;a href="about.html">About Me&lt;/a>
```

Remember, a website is basically a collection of pages linking to other HTML pages and files such as images and css files.
        </section>

        <section class="slide" data-markdown>
##HTML5 Sectioning Tags

Sometimes, multiple HTML elements need to be grouped together for organization and/or for styling. For example, the heading contains multiple elements inside of them (name and tagline) as well as the navigation on the about and contact page.

Prior to HTML5, the `&lt;div&gt;` tag was used for grouping elements together to create page layouts. The header and footer of the page might look something like this:

```xml
&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;Jane Smith&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;h2&gt;Web Developer + City Girl&lt;/h2&gt;
    
    &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;ul&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="">Home&lt;/a>&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="">About&lt;/a>&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="">Contact&lt;/a>&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

```

The `&lt;div&gt;` is still valid but HTML5 introduced a number of semantic tags that better describe blocks of content such as `&lt;header&gt;`, `&lt;footer&gt;`, `&lt;nav&gt;`, `&lt;section&gt;`.  The above example can be changed to this:

```xml
&lt;header&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;Jane Smith&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;h2&gt;Web Developer + City Girl&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;nav&gt;
        &lt;ul&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="">Home&lt;/a>&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="">About&lt;/a>&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="">Contact&lt;/a>&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
    &lt;/nav&gt;
&lt;/header&gt;
```

        <section class="slide" data-markdown>
##Good file naming habits

To create an HTML page, name your file using an `.html` extension and it will open in your default browser (much like .pdf for PDF files or .doc for Word files).  

Before we start another exercise, lets go over some best practices.

* Use lowercase letters.
    * **about.html** instead of **About.html** or **ABOUT.html**
* Avoid s p a c e s. Use underscores (_) or dashes (-). 
    * Dashes are generally preferred for SEO (search engine optimization).
    * **business_hours.html** or **business-hours.html** instead of **business hours.html**
    * The browser will interpret it as **business%20hours.html**
* Avoid symbols like # & * in your file name.
* Keep your file names concise, yet meaningful.
    * **about.html**, **contact.html** instead of **page1.html**, **page2.html**

**Protip!** These file naming tips can be applied to any files such as images, folders, CSS, etc.
        </section>

        <section class="slide" data-markdown>
##Exercise #2 - Adding pages and content (20mins)

Follow the instructions below to complete the exercise. We are still just adding HTML content so don't worry about how to style the page elements just yet. If you get stuck, you can take a peek in the examples folder: [exercise2-home.html](project/examples/exercise2-home.html), [exercise2-about.html](project/examples/exercise2-about.html), [exercise2-contact.html](project/examples/exercise2-contact.html)

**Protip!** Copy and paste repeated content using keyboard shortcuts to speed up your work flow.  
`ctrl/cmnd + c` to copy  
`ctrl/cmnd + x` to copy and cut    
`ctrl/cmnd + v` to paste  
`ctrl/cmnd + s` to save

1. Create an About page and name it **about.html**
    * Save it in the same folder as **index.html** (project folder)
    * Be sure to include all the basic HTML tags
    * Add the header and nav markup referenced in [HTML5 Sectioning Tags](index.html#slide23)
    * Use **relative** links to navigate between pages
    * Add the footer content created in **index.html** in the previous exercise.
1. Create a Contact page and name it **contact.html**
    * Follow the same instructions as the About page
1. Add the same navigation markup and relative links to **index.html** *BUT* since the structure and style is different, put the nav HTML **above** the header tag, not inside like About and Contact. The order of the HTML will matter when we add CSS to it later.

```xml
&lt;nav&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="">Home&lt;/a>&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="">About&lt;/a>&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="">Contact&lt;/a>&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/nav&gt;

&lt;header&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;Jane Smith&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;h2&gt;Web Developer + City Girl&lt;/h2&gt;  
&lt;/header&gt;
```
        </section>

        <section class="slide" data-markdown>
##Leave a Comment

Sometimes you want to leave notes for yourself (or others) but don't want it to display in the browser. That's when comments can be really helpful. Comments can be used for:

* hiding code for later use
* leaving notes
* organizing the document

The syntax for comments start with `&lt;!--` and ends with `--&gt;`.

```
&lt;!-- This is my comment. Comments should always be included between the dashes. -->
```
        </section>

        <section class="slide">
            <h2>Void / Self-closing Element</h2>

            <p>Void tags donâ€™t format content â€” instead, they render or embed objects in the page. These tags <strong>do not</strong> come in pairs since they do not wrap content like the other tags weâ€™ve been using so far. They are the content!</p>

            <p>The syntax is slightly different in the latest version of HTML so you may see it written in two ways. Prior to HTML5, these tags were self-closed with a forward slash (/) immediately before the right angled bracket (&gt;). In HTML5, void tags are not required to self close.</p>

            <p>A common void tag is the <code>&lt;br /&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;br&gt;</code> tag used to create a line break.</p>

<pre><code class="xml">&lt;p&gt;This text&lt;br&gt;goes over&lt;br&gt;several&lt;br&gt;lines.&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
            
            <!-- example -->
            <p>This text<br>goes over<br>several<br>lines.</p>

            <p>Another example of a void element is the horizontal rule, <code>&lt;hr&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;hr /&gt;</code>.</p>

            <!-- example -->
            <hr>
        </section>

        <section class="slide">
            <h2>Adding images</h2>

            <p>Images are another example of a void element.  Just like links, image tags also requires an attribute to define the file path of the image file. However, it uses the <code>src</code> attribute (not <code>href</code>).  The value can be an absolute or relative path. The below is an example of an absolute path.</p>

            <pre><code>&lt;img src="http://fillmurray.com/200/300"&gt;</code></pre>

            <p><img src="http://fillmurray.com/200/300"></p>

##The alt attribute

`alt` is an optional image **attribute** and refers to *alternative text*. Alt text is read by screen reading software used by visually impaired users.

It also displays when there's a broken or missing image due to typos or moved files. It should be a short description of the image.

HTML tags can contain more than one attribute. Here's how you would use the `alt` attribute with the `src` attribute.

```
&lt;img src="images/profile.jpg" alt="Jane Smith">
```
        </section>
    
        <section class="slide" data-markdown>
##Adding your own images

Just like links, you can use a **relative** path to link to your own images.  It's common practice to create a folder to organize images separate from HTML files. 

In your **project** folder, there is already an **images** folder included in your download.  Use the default **profile.jpg** image contained inside or add your own to this folder.

Remember, relative paths are based on the folder structure.  Since the HTML pages are *outside* of the **images** folder, the folder name needs to be included in the file path.

```xml
&lt;img src="images/profile.jpg" alt="description of image">
```
        </section>

        <section class="slide" data-markdown>
##Image Types
There are many different file types that can be used for the web. Each type is best suited for specific kinds of images. Use the format that maintains the best quality while reducing the file size.

**jpg** - used for photographs with lots of rich colours or gradients

**png** - used for images with transparent or opaque backgrounds

**gif** - used for images with minimal colour variation and of course, for animated gifs!

**svg** - used for 2D graphics and is very scaleable. Based on XML and can be used as a image file or in the HTML document. When included as HTML, CSS can be used to style the svg!

##Exercise #3 - Update the About page (15 mins)

Let's add some more content to your About page. Use the `&lt;section>` tag to create a new sectioning block for the page content and add it under the `&lt;header>` tag and before the `&lt;footer>` like this:

```xml
&lt;header&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;Jane Smith&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;h2&gt;Web Developer + City Girl&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;nav&gt;
        ...
    &lt;/nav&gt;
&lt;/header&gt;

&lt;section&gt;
    page content here
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;footer&gt;
    ...
&lt;/footer&gt;
```

1. Inside of the `section` tag, add a profile picture.
1. After the image tag, add an `h2` for the page title.
1. After the `h2`, add a couple of paragraphs about you, or use placholder text.

Just like images, there are many services available for placeholder text.

#Intro to CSS
##The presentation layer
        </section>
    
        <section class="slide" data-markdown>
##CSS & HTML

CSS is its own language and has different syntax rules than HTML but it the two are closely paired. CSS is made up of rules that refer to HTML elements and define what those elements should look like.

CSS separates content (i.e. text) from presentation (i.e. text colour) and helps to reduce redundancy and save time.  

Older presentational HTML tags like `&lt;center>` and `&lt;font>` should no longer be used because CSS takes care of presentation and styles.
        </section>

        <section class="slide" data-markdown>
            ##CSS Terminology & Syntax
    
            **Selectors:** used to determine which element(s) to apply the styles to. Can target an HTML tag, class or ID.  
            **Declaration block:** consists of a list of declarations (rules to follow) wrapped in curly braces `{}`.  
            **Declarations** or rules to follow, are written using `property:value` pairs.

            ```css
            selector {
                property: value;
            }
            ```
            **Properties** determine the type of style to be applied to
            the element (e.g. color).  
            **Values** are specific to the property. Declarations must end with a semi-colon (`;`) to indicate that the instruction is complete.

            ##Descendant selectors
            
            Matches any element that is a descendant (nested tag) of the element declared before it.
            
            ```css
            p a {
                /* targets only anchor link tags nested inside of a p tag */
            }
            ```
            **Protip!** Just like [Inception](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1375666/), never go more than three levels deep. Truth.

            ```
            nav ul li a span {
                /* NOOOOOOOOOOO */
            }
            ```

            Feel free to skip a level but be mindful of specificity rules. For example, `nav ul li a` would override `nav a` because it's more specific. 

            Itâ€™s usually easier to start with generic selectors and make them more specific, as needed, rather than starting with very specific selectors and adding extra markup or classes to try to override the styles.

            ##Comments
            
            Comments are written within a slash & asterix (`/* */`) and closes in the opposite order. Comments can be used for the same reasons as HTML comments: leaving notes, hiding code for later and for organization.
            
            ```
            p {
                color: #cc0066; /* magenta */
            }

            /* HEADER STYLES */
            header {
                width: 80%;
            }

            /*  Saving this for later
            .slider {
                width: 100px;
                background: red;
            }
            */ 
            ``` 
        </section>

        <section class="slide" data-markdown>
##Referencing CSS - Inline & Internal

There are three ways to include (otherwise known as *referencing*) CSS in an HTML page.

**INLINE** - can be added to any HTML element using the `style` *attribute*.

```
&lt;p style=&quot;color: blue;&quot;&gt;I'm writing CSS!&lt;/p&gt;
```

This technique should be avoided but it's good to know how it works in case you encounter it "in the wild."

**INTERNAL** - uses `&lt;style&gt;` and is included in the `&lt;head&gt;` element.

```    
&lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;Page Title&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;style&gt;
        h1 {
            font-size: 16px;
        }
    &lt;/style&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm still writing CSS!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
```

This method is preferred over *inline* css, however it is still inefficient because if you had multiple web pages, the style block and any revision would have to be replicated on every single page.
        </section>

        <section class="slide" data-markdown>
##Referencing CSS - External

The external method links to a separate style sheet file and is recommended because it separates the CSS from the HTML document. The style sheet is referenced in the `&lt;head&gt;` of the document. Only the CSS file needs to be updated rather than the CSS block on every single page.

Referenced in the head element with a `&lt;link&gt;` tag and two **attributes**, `rel` (relationship) and `href`. Just like creating links, the value of the `href` points to the location of the style sheet. 

Though it is not required, css files are often saved in a css folder for organization, so make sure the file path points to the appropriate directory.

```
&lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;Page Title&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; href=&quot;css/style.css&quot;&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
```
        </section>
        
        <section class="slide" data-markdown>
##Mini-exercise

Create a new CSS file by selecting **File > New File** in Sublime Text or use a shortcut, **CMND/CNTRL + N**. Name the file with a **.css** extension.  Some commonly used names are **global.css**, **main.css** or **style.css**.

Remember, external stylesheets are added using the `&lt;link>` tag.

```
&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="css/style.css">
```
**Protip!** Can't remember the syntax?  Sublime Text has a shortcut.  Simply type "link" with no angled brackets and press tab. Voila!

Let's do a quick check to see if it works and is linked properly by adding a background color on the entire viewport as a test.

```
body {
    background: lightblue;
}
```
Notice that the content doesn't quite go to the edge of the page? That's because there's default spacing in the body element. 

![](framework/img/workshop/body-margin.png)

Remove the test background color and replace it with `padding` and `margin` to reset the value. (more on these later)

```
body {
    padding: 0;
    margin: 0;
}
```

            ##Web safe fonts

            Fonts can be changed with the `font-family` **property**. However, not all fonts are installed on all computers so it's recommended to use fonts that are considered *web safe* &mdash; fonts that are commonly included on most computers.

            It's best practice to list at least two or three font options to provide a fall-back if the user doesn't have the preferred fonts installed.

            ```
            body {
                font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;
            }
            ```

            Here's a handy resource for referencing web safe fonts: [CSS Font Stack](http://cssfontstack.com/).
        </section>

        <section class="slide" data-markdown>
            ##Web fonts

            For more options beyond web safe fonts, services like [Google Fonts](http://www.google.com/fonts/) make it easier to add variety. Google Fonts allows you to link directly to their *hosted* stylesheet and fonts and no file downloads are necessary. To use these fonts:

            * Select the fonts you want to use and **Add to Collection**.  
            * You can **Review** them to take a closer look, then choose **Use** when ready.
            * Select font weights. The more you choose, the more it will slow down page load time.
            * The default character set should contain what you need. Only select an option if you need to add additional language support.
            * Grab the `&lt;link&gt;` code snippet and add it the `&lt;head&gt;` part of your page.
            * Use the new fonts with the `font-family` property as listed in the example on the Google Fonts page.

            That's it!

            ##CSS color property
            There are a few different ways to declare a colour value.

            **colour keywords** - you can use the actual name of the colour for most basic colours (red, green, blue, pink) as well as a few fancy ones like "papayaWhip" and "paleGoldenrod".

            **RGB (red-green-blue) / hex value** - the most common way to specify a colour. A hex code is made up of the number sign, #, followed by six hexadecimal characters (0-9, A-F) or three hexadecimal characters (0-9, A-F).

            Not sure how to find these colours? As usual, the internet provides a plethora of resources.

            ##Cascading, Inheritance and Specificity

            CSS executes from top to bottom (hence "cascading"), so be careful of the the order of your CSS declarations. The declaration that comes *after* will override the one that came before.

            In this example, what colour will the `&lt;h1&gt;` be?

            ```
            h1 {
                color: black;
            }
            h1 {
                color: blue;
            }
            ```
        </section>
        <section class="slide" data-markdown>
            ##Cascading, Inheritance and Specificity

            One of the strengths of CSS is styles can be inherited from parent to child elements using the family tree relationship between the elements.

            ```
            &lt;body&gt;
                &lt;h1&gt;My Website&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;!-- child of body --&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;This is a paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- sibling of h1 --&gt;
            &lt;/body&gt;
            ```
            ```
            body {
                color: blue;
                font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;
            }
            h1 {
                color: black;
            }
            ```

            In the above example, the CSS properties in the body selector is inherited by the children and descendants so all the text would be blue and display the Helvetica font. However, when a more specific selector is used (`h1`), it overrides the inherited values because it's more *specific*.
        </section>
    
        <section class="slide" data-markdown>
##Exercise #4 - Typography

1. Practice using [Google Fonts](https://www.google.com/fonts).  Find 2-3 fonts to be used for the body text, header and highlighted text.  

    Picking fonts is hard. Need some help?  Try Source Sans Pro, Quicksand, Merriweather or Codystar.  The example project uses Open Sans (light), Nixie One and Pacifico. 

1. Add the Google font stylesheet to the `&lt;head>` of all three documents so the font files will load and can be accessed.  Put it *before* your CSS file.

    ```
    &lt;title&gt;Jane Smith | About Me&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;link href='http://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Nixie+One|Open+Sans:300|Pacifico' rel='stylesheet' type='text/css'&gt;
    &lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; href=&quot;css/styles.css&quot;&gt;
    ```

1. In the sample project, most of site uses the same font and color except for the `h1` and a couple of accented blocks of text.  Let's put the main font styles using the `body` selector.

    ```
    body {
        font-family: "Open Sans", sans-serif;
        color: #333;
    }
    ```
    Remember the family tree?  Since `body` is the ancestor of all the elements nested within, these styles are *inherited* by the child & descendant elements.

1. Let's make the main heading (your name) a different font to set it apart from the rest of the headings. Since this style is going to be applied only to the main heading, use `h1` as the selector.

    ```
    h1 {
        font-family: "Nixie One", serif;
    }
    ```
1. Both `h1` and `h2` share similar styles. They both are styled with uppercase letters and don't use the default bold styles of headings.  When multiple elements share the same styles, we can **combine** selectors to apply the styles in one declaration block.  Combine selectors by separating them with a comma.

    ```
    h1, h2 {
        font-weight: 300;
        text-transform: uppercase;
    }
    ```
1. Links by default are blue in colour so it does not inherit the color property declared in the body.  To change the colour of the link, use the specific element selector.  

    Make the color different from the rest of the text to indicate it's a link.  You can also remove the default underline with CSS as well!
    ```
    a {
      color: #bf6d50;
      text-decoration: none;
    }
    ```

Your page should look like [example 4](project/examples/exercise4-about.html).  As long as your CSS file is linked on three pages, notice how the styles are now shared across all three pages.

            #The Box Model
        </section>
            
        <section class="slide" data-markdown>
            ##What is The Box Model?

            The browser looks at every HTML element on the page as a rectangular box. The CSS Box Model describes the way CSS styles the size and spacing of HTML elements. Understanding the box model is crucial for understanding how to position elements with CSS to create the desired page layout. This is one of the trickiest part of CSS, so don't worry if it seems confusing!

            CSS uses 5 properties to determine the size and spacing of these boxes:

            * `margin` - adds/removes space *outside* of the element
            * `padding` - adds/removes space *inside* of the element
            * `border` - adds a border outside of the element
            * `width` - can be set to a specific size via CSS
            * `height` - can be set to a specific size via CSS
        </section>

        <section class="slide">
            <h2>Padding and Margin</h2>

            <p>The <code>padding</code> and <code>margin</code> can both be declared using similar syntax of 1 to 4 values. Values can be declared using different measurement units but pixels or percentages are most commonly used. Setting the value to "0" will <strong>remove</strong> any default space on an HTML element. Any positive value will <strong>add</strong> space.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>4 values means top, right, bottom, left</li>
                <li>3 values means top, right/left, bottom</li>
                <li>2 values means top/bottom, right/left</li>
                <li>1 value means the same amount of padding on all sides</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Change some of the margin & padding settings below using 1-4 values and see what happens!</p>

        </section>

        <section class="slide" data-markdown>
            ##Padding and Margin (continued)
            Both properties can also be declared by specifying a particular side.

            ```
            padding-top: 10px;
            padding-right: 10px;
            padding-bottom: 10px;
            padding-left: 10px;
            ```
            ```
            margin-top: 10px;
            margin-right: 10px;
            margin-bottom: 10px;
            margin-left: 10px;
            ```
        </section>

        <section class="slide" data-markdown>
            ##Border

            The `border` property resides between the `margin` and `padding` and creates an outline around the element. It, too, has longhand and shorthand syntax.
            
            ```
            /* longhand */
            border-width: 2px;
            border-style: solid;
            border-color: red;

            /* shorthand */
            border: 2px solid red;
            ```
            Like padding and margin, a specific side of the element can be specified.
            
            ```
            /* longhand */
            border-top-width: 2px;
            border-top-style: solid;
            border-top-color: red;

            /* shorthand */
            border-top: 2px solid red;
            ```

            ##Box Model Fix!

            Luckily, thereâ€™s a fix for this. Enter the [box-sizing: border-box](http://www.paulirish.com/2012/box-sizing-border-box-ftw/) fix ftw! (Updated Aug 2014)

            It is recommended to add this snippet to all your projects.

            ```
            /* apply a natural box layout model to all elements, but allowing components to change */
            html {
                box-sizing: border-box;
            }
            *, *:before, *:after {
                box-sizing: inherit;
            }

            #Elements
        </section>

        <section class="slide" data-markdown>
            ##Inline vs Block Elements
            By default, some HTML elements are displayed as block or inline elements.

            ###Block Elements

            * takes up 100% width of its container, no matter how long the actual content is
            * will be the same height as its content
            * always starts on a new line
            * can wrap other block level elements or inline elements
            * can apply sizing related CSS to it (margin, padding, height, width)

            ###Inline Elements

            * will be the height and width of its content
            * always appears "in a line" with other inline level elements
            * can wrap other inline elements but cannot wrap block level elements *except* `&lt;a&gt;` tags.  This is only valid with an HTML5 doctype.
            * does not render CSS height and width at all, will apply margin and padding but with unexpected results

            ###Inline-block

            * best of both worlds
            * floats left and is the size & height of its content, like inline elements
            * accepts height and width values like block elements

            ##CSS Display property

            These default display styles can be changed using the CSS `display` property.

            `display: inline` can be used to get block level elements to line up side by side, in a line.

            `display: block` can be used to make inline elements behave like a block level element

            `display: inline-block` is the best of both worlds. Elements will line up side by side, like inline elements and also render sizing properties like block elements.
            
            `display: none;` will hide the element.

            Let's go back to the previous slide's example and try using the `display` property.

            ##CSS Float Property

            Remember, block-style HTML elements like `&lt;p>`, `&lt;div>` and `&lt;section>` automatically start on a new line and stack on top of each other. To get two block elements to align side-by-side, the `float` property can also be used. 

            CSS floats can float elements left or right.

            **However**, we have to break the natural stacking flow when an element is floated. This will cause any element *after* the floated element to try to move up beside it or just not display properly because we've disrupted the natural stacking flow. The parent container will also collapse.

            **Also**, if there is no width set, the element will float but the width will automatically be the width of its content.

            ##Float, Clear And Clearfix

            First we have to break it, then put it back together. We need to "reset" the float to get the rest of the page to go back to normal.  There are a couple ways to do it.

            One of the most confusing CSS concepts is when to use the different techniques, `clear: both` or the `.clearfix` class. 

            Rule of thumb: if there's is an element that *follows* the floated element, apply `clear: both` to that element. This will clear the float. If all the elements need to be floated, apply the `clearfix` to the parent element to force clear the children.

            Let's look at an example here: http://jsfiddle.net/unjcxses/

            ##Update CSS file
            Before moving onto the next exercise, let's add that [box-sizing fix](http://www.paulirish.com/2012/box-sizing-border-box-ftw/) as well as the [clearfix class](http://nicolasgallagher.com/micro-clearfix-hack/) to our CSS file. Put this at the very top since they are global styles.

            html {

            }
            *, *:before, *:after {
              box-sizing: inherit;
            }
            
            /* clears floated child elements */

            ##Exercise #5 - Header & Nav (15 mins)

            Follow the instructions below as far as you can. Check these changes on either the About or Contact page. The Home page will be styled after since it's different from the other two pages.

            Though all the CSS is listed, try adding in one line at a time to see and understand what each property does.  Feel free to leave comments for yourself in the code to explain what each line is doing! 

            There's a couple more concepts to go through to finish styling the header and nav, so your page should look like [example 5](project/examples/exercise5-about.html).

            **Bonus**: If you finish early, take some time to find a background image or pick on from the images folder or add some comments to your CSS to organize it.  See [sample here](project/examples/css/exercise5.css).

            1. Remove the default space from the `h1` and `h2` and set the font size.

                ```
                h1, h2 {
                    font-weight: 300;
                    text-transform: uppercase;
                    margin: 0; /* removes default space */
                    line-height: 1; /* tightens up the space between the headings */
                }
                ```
            1. Set the size for only the headings in the header.

                ```
                header h1 {
                    font-size: 36px;
                }
                header h2 {
                    font-size: 18px;
                }
                ```
            1. Add padding to `header` and `section` so there's an equal amount of space around the content blocks.
            
                ```
                header,
                section {
                  padding: 20px 30px;
                }
                ```
            1. Remove default list styles and get each item to line up in a line.
                ```
                nav ul {
                    list-style-type: none; /* removes bullets */
                    margin: 0;
                    padding: 0;
                }
                nav ul li {
                    display: inline-block;
                }
                ```
            1. Add some space around the links. It's better to put padding on the anchor link rather the the list item because padding adds space on the *inside*.  Putting it on the link with make the click area bigger.
                
                ```
                nav a {
                    padding: 5px 15px;
                    text-transform: uppercase;
                }
                ```

            ##Positioning in CSS
            
            Sometimes floats and display just doesn't cut it. 

            The `position` property can be used to place elements in specific spots on the page without affecting the elements around it the way floats do.  There are three options: `relative`, `absolute` and `fixed`. Elements are all `static` by default.

            `position` is used in conjunction with **offset properties**: `top`, `right`, `bottom`, and `left`. These are use to identify where an element will be positioned.
        </section>
        <section class="slide">
            <h2>Position: relative</h2>
            
            <p>When setting the position to <code>relative</code>, elements will still appear within the <strong>normal flow</strong> a page but will unlock the additional offset properties (top, right, bottom, left).  You can use these values to nudge the element in different directions. Try adding a top value (or any offset property).</p>

            <textarea class="snippet" data-subject="#relative">.box { 
    width: 100px;

            <h2>Position: absolute</h2>
            
            <p>When positioning an element as <code>absolute</code>, it needs to also be paired with <code>relative</code> positioning. <code>relative</code> on it's own doesn't affect other elements but it is used to <em>contain</em> an <code>absolute</code> position element to a particular spot. Otherwise, it will position itself to the <em>viewport</em>, or browser window.</p>

            ##Class Selectors

            HTML gives us a couple ways to attach extra identifying information to target elements in a way that is more specific. Two *attributes* called `class` and `id` can be used.

            A `class` *attribute* can be added to any element but the value is defined by you.  The class can then be used as a selector to apply styles to any element that references the class attribute.  

            Classes can be used multiple times on the same page. In CSS, classes are denoted by a leading period.

            ```xml
            &lt;p&gt;Regular text&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;special&quot;&gt;Special text here.&lt;/p&gt;
            ```
            ```
            p {
                color: red;
                font-family: Georgia, "Times New Roman", serif;
            }
            .special {
                text-transform: uppercase;
            }
            ```
        </section>
        <section class="slide" data-markdown>
            ##Mini-Exercise

            Let's create a class called `highlight` and assign it an accent colour. I can now add this class to any element and it will apply this style.

            ```
            .highlight {
                color: #bf6d50;
            }
            ```

            Using a span tag, wrap it around your first name on the homepage and apply this class.

            ```xml
            &lt;h1&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;Jane&lt;/span&gt;Smith&lt;/h1&gt;
            ```

            Now it looks like this!  Add this anywhere you want some highlighted text!

            ![](framework/img/workshop/highlighted-text.png)
        </section>
        <section class="slide" data-markdown>
            ##id Selectors

            `id` *attributes* are similar to `class` *attributes* because it can also be added to any element and given any value.

            However, it can be used only **once** per page.  IDs should be reserved for significant style rules. Some developers prefer not to use IDs at all for CSS styling because of the specificity rules and because classes can be used once or multiple times, making it more flexible.

            In CSS, IDs are denoted by a leading hash symbol (`#`).
            ```
            #header {
                width: 800px;
            }
            ```
        </section>
        <section class="slide" data-markdown>
            ##class and id Names

            When choosing a class or id name, choose a descriptive name and do not use spaces. Hyphens (-), underscores (_) and camel case are acceptable. CSS is also case sensitive, so while these three examples look similar, CSS will read these as three different classes so it's important (for you own sanity) to pick one style and be consistent.
            
            ```
            class="content-wrapper"
            class="content_wrapper"
            class="contentWrapper"
            ```

            ##Exercise #6 - About, Header & Nav, pt 2

            1. Position the nav to the top right of the header element.
            
                ```
                nav {
                  position: absolute;
                  right: 20px;
                  top: 20px;
                }
                ```

            1. The entire header itself should be set to fixed positioning so when you scroll the page, it stays fixed at the top.
                ```
                header {
                    position: fixed;
                }
                ```
                Notice that adding this property changes the page. When you position an element, it automatically becomes the width of its content. Set the width to 100% so it becomes as wide as the browser. 

                Also, set the background to white so the content underneath doesn't show through when you scroll the page. Add a border on the bottom to create a separation of the header from the page content.

                ```
                header {
                    position: fixed;
                    width: 100%;
                    background: white;
                }
                ```
            1. Positioning takes the element out of the natural stacking order.  See how the profile picture "jumped" underneath the header when position: fixed was applied? It's because it doesn't "see" that there's an element before it, so it wants to slide up to the next available slot.  Add some padding on the top of the section element to push the content down below the fixed header.
                ```
                section {
                    padding-top: 125px;
                }
                ```
            1. Add a class of "profile-image" to the image tag in your about page.  Add a left float to get the text to wrap around it.

                ```
                .profile-image {
                  float: left;
                }
                ```
            1. The text floats now, but it's a little squishy. Try setting the image width to be 50% off the page and add some margin on the right to create space.

                ```
                .profile-image {
                    float: left;
                    width: 50%;
                    margin-right: 20px;
                }
                ```
            1. That looks much better but look what happened to the footer! All elements that come after floated elements want to float too as long as there is space for them.  Let's put the page back to it's natural stacking order by clearing the float on the footer because that's where we want things to go back to normal.

                ```
                footer {
                    clear: both;
                }
                ```


            Your page should look like [example 6](project/examples/exercise6-about.html).  Note how the header looks the same on all three pages now... except the home page!  Where did the navigation disappear off to?
        </section>
        
        <section class="slide" data-markdown>
            ##Class attribute & the Home page styles

            The final design for the home page is different from the other two pages including the order of the HTML. On **index.html**, the nav HTML comes *before* the header.  The nav didn't disappear, it's just *under* the header.  

            If the header wasn't set to be fixed to the top of the page, it would stack underneath the nav.

            For the home page, we can use a **class** attribute to override the styles that are shared between the About and Contact page and apply specific styles needed for the home page.

            Let's add a class to the `body` tag so we can override any styles for any element contained within the page.

            ```
            &lt;body class=&quot;home&quot;&gt;
            ```
        </section>
        <section class="slide" data-markdown>
            ##Exercise #7 - Homepage Header & Nav

            Override the header styles not needed for the home page.

            * remove the fixed positioning
            * remove the white background colour
            * remove the border bottom
            * center align the text
            * push the heading down from the top of the page

            We'll use the new `home` class we created to override the styles by using a more specific selector.

            ```
            .home header {
                position: static;
                background: transparent;
                border-bottom: none;
                text-align: center;
                padding-top: 100px;
            }
            ```
            Now let's update the heading sizes.  Feel free to use what looks good to you. These are just guidelines.
                
            ```
            .home header h1 {
              font-size: 120px;
            }
            .home header h2 {
              font-size: 40px;
            }
            ```

            Your page should now look something like [example 7](project/examples/exercise7-home.html), located in your examples folder.
        </section>

        <section class="slide" data-markdown>
            ##Sticky Footer

            Remember the natural stacking order? HTML elements stack on top of each other in the order that they appear in the HTML.  Each element is as tall as their content (unless otherwise specified).  

            On the home page, the footer appears right below the headings. On the about page, it appears on the bottom because the content is long enough to scroll.  And on the contact page, you can't even see it because it's hidden underneath the positioned header!

            To ensure that your footer is always at the bottom of the page, no matter how long the page content is or how big the browser window is, use a "sticky footer".

            We'll be following these instructions: http://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/sticky-footer/
        </section>

        <section class="slide" data-markdown>
##Exercise #8 - Sticky Footer

First, we need to create a page wrapper around the page content only, not the footer content.  The home page HTML will look like similar to this: 

```
&lt;div class=&quot;page-wrap&quot;&gt;
    &lt;nav&gt;
        ...
    &lt;/nav&gt;

    &lt;header&gt;
        &lt;h1&gt;Jane Smith&lt;/h1&gt;
        &lt;h2&gt;Web Developer + City Girl&lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;/header&gt;    
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- close .page-wrap --&gt;
&lt;footer&gt;
  ...
&lt;/footer&gt;
```

The about and contact pages will look like this:

```
&lt;div class=&quot;page-wrap&quot;&gt;
    &lt;header&gt;
        &lt;h1&gt;Jane Smith&lt;/h1&gt;
        &lt;h2&gt;Web Developer + City Girl&lt;/h2&gt;

        &lt;nav&gt;
            ...
        &lt;/nav&gt;
    &lt;/header&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- close .page-wrap --&gt;
&lt;footer&gt;
    ...
&lt;/footer&gt;
```
        </section>

        <section class="slide" data-markdown>
            ##Sticky Footer CSS

            ```
            /* sticky footer */
            html, body {
              height: 100%;
            }
            .page-wrap {
              min-height: 100%;
              margin-bottom: -35px; /* equal to footer height */
            }
            .page-wrap:after {
              content: "";
              display: block;
            }
            footer, .page-wrap:after {
              height: 35px; /* must be the same height as footer */
            }
            footer {
              background: #222;
              color: #ccc;
            }
            ```

            Compare your page with [example 8](project/examples/exercise8-home.html).

            ##Forms: organizing the interface
            
            Forms are used to capture information from a user. The information processing and form submission usually requires the use of a server-side language such as PHP, Ruby or Python. But there are different services available to help do the processing for us without writing any of these languages!

            Today we're going to use http://forms.brace.io/ to submit our form info and the information will be forwarded to your email. Simple!

            All forms begin with the `form` element and requires 
            two attributes, `method` (defines how the form will communicate with the web server) and `action` (provides the file path to where the form script is processed after the form is submitted.

            Since we're using a 3rd party service, the `action` value is their url *and* the email you want the form to be submitted to.

            ```xml
            &lt;form method="POST" action="http://forms.brace.io/hello@email.com">
                ...
            &lt;/form>
            ```
        </section>

        <section class="slide" data-markdown>
            ##Forms (continued)

            `input` elements are used to allow the user to type in their information and is used with a `type` attribute to determine the kind of information it is.

            The `label` tags are used to label the input.

            The `name` attribute is used to label the fields when sending the form data to the server. 
            
            The `for` and `id` attributes are used to associate the label to the input and should have matching values.

            A form can contain any HTML markup (paragraphs, lists, etc.) in addition to form specific HTML tags.

            [Each part of a form is considered a paragraph](http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec-LC/forms.html#forms) and can be separated using `&lt;p>` elements. 

            **Example:** [MDN form example](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Forms/How_to_structure_an_HTML_form/Example)
        </section>

        <section class="slide" data-markdown>
            ##Exercise #9 - Contact Form

            On your contact page, under the header, create a `&lt;section>` tag.  Add the below markup *in between* the `section` element.

            Brace.io requires that you verify your email. The verification email will be sent on the first form submit so make sure you test your form first!

            ```xml
            &lt;form class="contact-form" action=&quot;http://forms.brace.io/hello@your-email.com&quot; method=&quot;POST&quot;&gt;
                &lt;h2&gt;Let's meet for coffee!&lt;/h2&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Send me a message at &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:hello@your-email.com&quot;&gt;hello@your-email.com&lt;/a&gt;, 
                use the form below or say &quot;hi!&quot; on one of my social networks.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;
                    &lt;label for=&quot;name&quot;&gt;Name&lt;/label&gt;
                    &lt;input id=&quot;name&quot; type=&quot;text&quot; name=&quot;name&quot;&gt;
                &lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;
                    &lt;label for=&quot;email&quot;&gt;Email&lt;/label&gt;
                    &lt;input id=&quot;email&quot; type=&quot;email&quot; name=&quot;replyto&quot;&gt;
                &lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;
                    &lt;label for=&quot;message&quot;&gt;Message&lt;/label&gt;
                    &lt;textarea id=&quot;message&quot; name=&quot;message&quot;&gt;&lt;/textarea&gt;
                &lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;input type=&quot;submit&quot; value=&quot;SEND&quot;&gt;
            &lt;/form&gt;
            ```

            Your contact page and form should look similar to [Example 9](project/examples/exercise9-contact.html).
        </section>
        <section class="slide" data-markdown>
            ##Exercise #10 - Background Images

            Before we style the contact form, let's go over how background images work.  We've added images in the HTML using `img` but we can also set images as a background style using CSS.
            
            ```
            background-image: url(path/to/file.jpg); /* longhand */
            background: url(path/to/file.jpg);/* shorthand */
            ```
            Since our CSS file is *inside* a folder, use `../` to go *up and out* of the folder to get to the image files. Let's add it to our Contact page. Just like the home page, add a class to the `body` tag to override or customize any styles for any element contained within the contact page.

            ```
            &lt;body class=&quot;contact&quot;&gt;
            ```

            ```
            .contact {
                background: url(../images/your-image.jpg);
            }
            ```
            
            Note how the images repeat (unless you have a really large image). We can override that with another property, `background-repeat` or just add it to the shorthand `background` property.
            
            ```
            /* shorthand */
            .contact {
                background: url(../images/background-1.jpg) no-repeat; 
            }

            /* longhand */
            .contact {
                background-image: url(../images/background-1.jpg); 
                background-repeat: no-repeat;
            }
            ```
        </section>
        <section class="slide" data-markdown>
            ##CSS3 Background-size

            The image is no longer repeating but it doesn't fit the space either.  Thanks to CSS3, we can now change the size of a background image! 

            Let's take a look at an example of the different options: http://jsfiddle.net/zyjtde73/1/

            `background-size` is the longhand property.  To include it in the shorthand `background` property, it *must* be included after `background-position`, separated with the `/` character.  
            
            ```
            .contact {
                background-image: url(../images/background-1.jpg);
                background-repeat: no-repeat;
                background-position: 50%;
                background-size: 100%;
            }
            ```
            ```
            .contact {
                background: url(../images/background-1.jpg) no-repeat 50% / 100%;
            }
            ```
            If no background position value is being used, background-size won't work in the shorthand property so in this case, it may be less error prone to add it via the longhand property.
            
            ```
            .contact {
                background: url(../images/background-1.jpg) no-repeat 50%;
                background-size: 100%;
            }
            ```
        </section>

        <section class="slide" data-markdown>
            ##Exercise #10 - Background Images (continued)

            1. Go back to the `.contact` CSS and add the background-size option.
            
                ```
                .contact {
                    background: url(../images/background-8.jpg) no-repeat;
                    background-size: cover;
                }
                ```

            2. Add a different background image for the home page.

            There are a few background images in your project folder to choose from or check out these resources for free images:

            * http://superfamous.com/
            * http://www.gratisography.com/
            * http://littlevisuals.co/
            * http://nos.twnsnd.co/
            * http://unsplash.com/


            Your pages should now look similar to [example 10](project/examples/exercise10-home.html).
        </section>

        <section class="slide">
            <h2>Center aligning with margin</h2>
            <p>The margin property can also be used to center align block level elements. First, a width needs to be set. Then, setting the left &amp; right values to <code>auto</code> will find the center of the page. The <code>0</code> just refers to the top and bottom value.</p>

            <textarea class="snippet" data-subject="#margin-auto">background-color: lightblue;
height: 100px;
width: 600px;
margin: 0 auto;</textarea>
            <div id="margin-auto">box</div>
        </section>

        <section class="slide" data-markdown>
            ##Exercise #11 - Contact Form (continued)

            In the markup for the form, a class of `contact-form` was included in the `form` tag to be used for styling since all the form elements are contained within it.

            1. Set a width for the form and center align it on the page. Also add a background colour to see the text more clearly over the image.

                ```
                .contact-form {
                    width: 600px;
                    margin: 10px auto;
                    background: white;
                }
                ```
            
            1. Add some padding to `contact-form` to keep the text from going right up to the edge. Also try adding the CSS property `border-radius` to add some rounded corners.

                ```
                .contact-form {
                    width: 600px;
                    margin: 10px auto;
                    background: white;
                    padding: 20px;
                    border-radius: 4px;
                }
                ```
            1. To get the input and textarea to span all the way across the form, we can set the width to 100% so it takes up the entire width of the form. It's also possible to override the default border styles too.  Add height to the textarea just to give more room for the user to type a message.

                ```
                input, 
                textarea {
                  width: 100%;
                  border: 1px solid #ccc;
                  padding: 5px;
                }
                textarea {
                  height: 100px;
                }
                ```
            Your form should look similar to [example 11](project/examples/exercise11-contact.html).

            ##Getting ready Final Exercise #12

            Before creating the home page drop down menu, we'll need to talk about icon fonts and pseudo class first.
            
            ###Icon fonts
            Icon fonts are an easy way to add imagery to your web page but still have the flexibility of styling properties like size and colour using CSS since they *are* fonts!

            There's many to choose from but today we'll use Font Awesome:  
            [http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/)

            Under **Getting Started**, there are different options for adding the font files.  If using the CDN, remember to add the "http" to make it work when you run your page "locally" (on your computer).
            
            Simple to use, pick an icon you'd like to use and copy the supplied markup and class and that's it!

            ###Pseudo Class  
            A CSS pseudo-class is a selector that specifies a specific *state* of the selected element. Today we will be using `:hover` to apply a style only when the user hovers over the element specified by the selector.
            
            More about pseudo classes: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Pseudo-classes

        <section class="slide" data-markdown>
            ##Exercise #12 - Home Page Drop down menu

            1. Add [Font Awesome's CSS file](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/get-started/) to the `head` of your document and the markup for the [three-bar icon](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/icon/bars/) to the navigation.
            ```
            &lt;link href="http://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/font-awesome/4.2.0/css/font-awesome.min.css" rel="stylesheet">
            ```
            ```xml
            &lt;nav&gt;
                &lt;i class=&quot;fa fa-bars&quot; title=&quot;menu&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
                &lt;ul&gt;
                    &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;index.html&quot;&gt;Home&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
                    &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;about.html&quot;&gt;About&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
                    &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;contact.html&quot;&gt;Contact&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;/ul&gt;
            &lt;/nav&gt;
            ```
            It should look like this:

            ##Exercise #12 - Home Page Drop down menu
            
            The next step is to override the horizontal navigation styles that are shared among the other pages and make it specific to the home page.  There is already a class of `home` in the body so we can use that to make our selector more specific.

            1. Set the list items to display block so they line up on top of each other.

                ```
                .home nav li {
                    display: block;
                }
                ```

            1. Right align the icon and the list items.  This can be added to the `nav` selector so icon and list items will inherit the styles.  Change the font size to make it bigger too.  The icon will also need a little bit of padding to make the hover target a little bigger and for alignment.
                ```
                .home nav {
                    text-align: right;
                    font-size: 25px;
                }
                .fa-bars {
                    padding: 15px;
                }
                ```
            
            1. Now we need to hide the navigation list and show it when you hover over the icon.  Hide the list first.
                ```
                .home nav ul {
                    display: none;
                }
                ```

            1. With CSS, you can apply a hover on a parent element and use the descendant selector to change the style of it's children!

                ```
                .home nav:hover ul {
                    display: block;
                }
                .home a:hover {
                    color: black;
                }
                ```
            
            Your home page should now look similar to [example 12](project/examples/exercise12-home.html).

            ##Next steps & "Homework"

            Though we've covered a lot of material today, there are still lots of things to add to give your web page that extra personalization and polish.  

            Take a look at the files in the **final** folder for some ideas. Use the Font Awesome icons to add your social icons to the footer or try adding a [favicon](http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/how-to-make-a-favicon).

            There are also plenty of online resources available such as:

            ##Getting your site online

            You will need to register a domain name (www.mysite.com) and get hosting. Here are a couple domain & hosting options:
            
            * [hover.com](https://www.hover.com/?ircid=2799&irmpname=Ladies+Learning+Code)
            * [dreamhost.com](http://www.dreamhost.com/r.cgi?205190)  
            * [bluehost.com](http://www.bluehost.com/)

            To get your files online, you will need upload your files to your newly purchased hosting server.

            There are a few pieces of information you will need and are usually provided to you by your hosting service provider.

            * FTP Address
            * Username
            * Password

            Here's a nice tutorial getting your files online: [FTP For Beginners: How to Upload Your Files](http://webdesign.com/ftp-for-beginners-how-to-upload-your-files/)
